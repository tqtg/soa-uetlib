    "description": "Gone, But Not Forgotten rocketed Phillip Margolin into the select company of million-selling novelists. Here he displays again the same genius for best-selling suspense in another intricate, breathtaking thriller of multiple murder in the legal community of the Pacific Northwest.\nLaura Rizzati, a law clerk for Oregon Supreme Court Justice Robert Griffen, is found slain late one night in the deserted courthouse. Her office is ransacked but nothing seems to be missing. There are no suspects and no clues. The following month Griffen himself is killed by a car bomb in the driveway of his Portland home. This time, though, there is a suspect: in a shocking turn of events, Abigail Griffen, star prosecutor in the Multnomah County District Attorney's office and estranged wife of Justice Griffen, is charged with first degree murder.\nWith the same gripping suspense that drove Gone, But Not Forgotten onto the bestseller lists, this is a complex legalthriller with a truly startling ending.\n",

    "description": "These stories of myth and resurrection, of uncanny events and violent impulse, were with one exception written and published in the latter half of the 1920s, coinciding with the composition of Lawrence's controversial masterpiece Lady Chatterley's Lover. At this time Lawrence declared himself to be 'really awful sick of writing'; yet here we find some of his most beautiful, hauntingly melancholy fictions. In struggling to escape from their thwarted lives and to achieve human 'tenderness', the characters embody and continue the major preoccupations of Lawrence's work as a whole. 'Love Among the Haystacks' provides an early illustration of the intensity and innovation which made Lawrence one of the most distinctive and important of twentieth-century writers.\n",

Their male counterparts - Louis, the powerless tutor, and Robert, his cloth-manufacturing brother - also stand at odds to society's expectations. The novel is set in a period of social and political ferment, featuring class disenfranchisement, the drama of Luddite machine-breaking, and the divisive effects of the Napoleonic Wars. But Charlotte Brontes particular strength lies in exploring the hidden psychological drama of love, loss and the quest for identity. Personal and public agitation are brought together against the dramatic backdrop of her native Yorkshire. As always, Bronte challenges convention, exploring the limitations of social justice whilst telling not one but two love stories.\n",

Chieftain of the MacGregor clan, Rob Roy is a brave and fearless man, able and cunning. But he is also an outlaw with a price on his head, and as he and Francis join forces to pursue Rashleigh, he is constantly aware that he, too, is being pursued - and could be captured at any moment. Set on the eve of the 1715 Jacobite uprising, Rob Roy brilliantly evokes a Scotland on the verge of rebellion, blending historical fact and a novelist's imagination to create an incomparable portrait of intrigue, rivalry and romance.\n",

    "description": "Bannerworth Hall, Hampshire. Midnight. The night is woken by screams, from the bedroom of the beautiful and noble-hearted Flora. To their horror, her family discover that she has been the victim of a murderous attack. The Bannerworths are about to lose their home, to pay the debts of their dead father. The hunt is for his missing gold on, but then they begin to have doubts about their repulsive, hissing new neighbour, Sir Francis Varney, who is so eager to purchase the hall - and to marry the fair Flora! Their quest will take them from hall to charnel-house, and from village inn to deserted chancel. Can the Bannerworths - aided by Flora's fiance Charles Holland, Charles's uncle Admiral Bell, and the indomitable British Tar, Jack Pringle - defeat their terrible foe? and can they decipher the strange letter left by old Marmaduke Bannerworth, that seems to promise so much? Varney, the Vampyre, is one of the greatest of the Victorian penny romances, by one of its finest exponents -- the inimitable James Malcolm Rymer. First serialised between 1845 and 1847, it is one of the world's most enjoyable reads. It is also one of the major sources for Stoker's later masterpiece, Dracula.\n",

    "description": "Square marks the culmination of James's apprentice period as a novelist. With sharply focused attention upon just four principal characters, James provides an acute analysis of middle-class manners and behaviour in the New York of the 1870's, a period of great change in the life of the city. This change is explored through the device of setting the novel's action during the 1840s, similarly a period of considerable turbulence as the United States experienced the onset of rapid commercial and industrial expansion. Through the relationships between Austin Sloper, a celebrated physician, and his sister Lavinia Penniman, his daughter Catherine, and Catherine's suitor, Morris Townsend, James observes the contemporary scene as a site of competing styles and performances where authentic expression cannot be articulated or is subject to suppression.\n",

Peyrol, the rover, returns to a France at war and finds the actions of those around him still overborne by memories of revolutionary terror.\nConrads acute understanding of human psychology and its application across racial and ideological divides is the life-force of both stories.\n",

    "description": "Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, better known as Fanny Hill, is one of the most notorious texts in English literature. As recently as 1963 an unexpurgated edition was the subject of a trial, yet in the eighteenth century John Cleland's open celebration of sexual enjoyment was a best selling novel. Fanny's story, as she falls into prostitution and then rises to respectability, takes the form of a confession that is vividly coloured by copious and explicit physiological details of her carnal adventures. The moral outrage that this has always provoked has only recently been countered by serious critical appraisal. Cleland's highly entertaining book is a classic of erotica that holds a unique place in English fiction.\n",

    "description": "Examine your words well, and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your immediate feelings...\nAdam Bede (1859), George Eliot's first full-length novel, marked the emergence of an artist to rank with Scott and Dickens. Set in the English Midlands of farmers and village craftsmen at the turn of the eighteenth century, the book relates a story of seduction issuing in 'the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis'. But it is also a rich and pioneering record - drawing on intimate knowledge and affectionate memory - of a rural world that we have lost. The movement of the narration between social realism and reflection on its own processes, the exploration of motives, and the constant authorial presence all bespeak an art that strives to connect the fictional with the actual.\n",

    "description": "The Professor is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, in which she audaciously inhabits the voice and consciousness of a man, William Crimsworth. Like Jane Eyre he is parentless; like Lucy Snowe in Villette he leaves the certainties of England to forge a life in Brussels. But as a man, William has freedom of action, and as a writer BrontÃ« is correspondingly liberated, exploring the relationship between power and sexual desire. William s first person narration reveals his attraction to the dominating directress of the girls school where he teaches, played out in the school s secret garden . Balanced against this is his more temperate relationship with one of his pupils, Frances Henri, in which mastery and submission interplay. The Professor was published only after Charlotte BrontÃ« s death; today it gives us a fascinating insight into the first stirrings of her supreme creative imagination.\n",

    "description": "In the first part of this famous work, published in 1821 but then revised and expanded in 1856, De Quincey vividly describes a number of experiences during his boyhood which he implies laid the foundations for his later life of helpless drug addiction.The second part consists of his remarkable account of the pleasures and pains of opium, ostensibly offered as a muted apology for the course his life had taken but often reading like a celebration of it.\nThe Confessions of an English Opium-Eater is thus both a classic of English autobiographical writing - the prose equivalent, in its own time, of Wordsworth's The Prelude or Growth of a Poet's Mind - and at the same time a crucial text in the long history of the Western World's ambivalent relationship with hard drugs.Full of psychological insight and colourful descriptive writing, it surprised and fascinated De Quincey's contemporaries and has continued to exert its powerful and eccentric appeal ever since.\n",

    "description": "The Wings of the Dove is a tale of desire and possession, of love and death. It is in essence a simple story, but one that opens up the great subject of art: life itself. To tackle this, James moves between fairytale storylines and the startlingly modern techniques of his testing late style. An unspeakable subtext lies beneath the silence. Distinct points of view and different centres of consciousness betray the dislocation of the social facade from the desolation beneath. For all the familiar signs, there is a gulf between glamour and the underlying threat of loss. The eternal triangle of romance is played out here like a game on an international stage for the very highest stakes. It centres on 'the dying girl who wants to live - to live and love.' But those closest to her are in competition for what she can leave behind. Milly Theale, 'the heiress of all the ages', is imaged as a dove, a princess, a Renaissance beauty, but these symbols come at a dreadful cost. By the end of the novel we know, 'We shall never be again as we were!'\n",

    "description": "The sheer variety and accomplishment of Elizabeth Gaskell s shorter fiction is amazing. This new volume contains six of her finest stories that have been selected specifically to demonstrate this, and to trace the development of her art. As diverse in setting as in subject matter, these tales move from the gentle comedy of life in a small English country town in Dr Harrison s Confessions, to atmospheric horror in far north-west Wales with The Doom of the Griffiths. The story of Cousin Phillis, her masterly tale of love and loss, is a subtle, complex and perceptive analysis of changes in English national life during an industrial age, while the gripping Lois the Witch recreates the terrors of the Salem witchcraft trials in seventeenth-century New England, as Gaskell shrewdly shows the numerous roots of this furious outbreak of delusion. Whimsically modified fairy tales are set in a French chateau, while an engaging love story poetically evokes peasant life in wine-growing Germany.\n",

Stendhal himself claimed that no-one before him had ventured to portray with such verisimilitude the 'moral and morose' France of 1830. However 'moral and morose' his novel is definitely not. Ironic, fast-moving, entertaining and incisive in its social criticism, it is a novel of ambition and passion, of indignation and tenderness, of polemic and poetry, which speaks to us today, as clearly as it did to the author's contemporaries, of the heights, depths and idiocies of which our human nature is capable or culpable.\n",

    "description": "George Eliot's final novel, Daniel Deronda (1876), follows the intertwining lives of the beautiful but spoiled and selfish Gwendolene Harleth and the selfless yet alienated Daniel Deronda, as they search for personal and vocational fulfilment and sympathetic relationship. Set largely in the degenerate English aristocratic society of the 1860s, Daniel Deronda charts their search for meaningful lives against a background of imperialism, the oppression of women, and racial and religious prejudice. Gwendolen's attempts to escape a sadistic relationship and atone for past actions catalyse her friendship with Deronda, while his search for origins leads him, via Judaism, to a quest for moral growth. Eliot's radical dual narrative constantly challenges all solutions and ensures that the novel is as controversial now, as when it first appeared.\n",

It reports on the American Civil War through the eyes of Henry Fleming, an ordinary farm boy turned soldier. It evokes the chaos and the dull clatter of war: the acrid smoke, the incessant rumours of coming battles, the filth and cold, the numbing monotony, the unworldly wailing of the dying. Like an impressionist painter, Crane also captures the strange beauty of war: the brilliant red flags against a blue sky, steel bayonets flashing in the morning sun as soldiers step off into battle. In the midst of this chaotic outer world, he creates an intricate inner world as he takes us inside the head of Henry Fleming.\n",

    "description": "Set in the mid-19th century, and written from the author's first-hand experience, North and South follows the story of the heroine's movement from the tranquil but moribund ways of southern England to the vital but turbulent north. Elizabeth Gaskell's skilful narrative uses an unusual love story to show how personal and public lives were woven together in a newly industrial society. This is a tale of hard-won triumphs - of rational thought over prejudice and of humane care over blind deference to the market. Readers in the twenty-first century will find themselves absorbed as this Victorian novel traces the origins of problems and possibilities which are still challenging a hundred and fifty years later: the complex relationships, public and private, between men and women of different classes.\n",

    "author": "Daniel Defoe",
    "description": "The novel follows the life of its eponymous heroine through its many vicissitudes, which include her early seduction, careers in crime and prostitution, conviction for theft and transportation to the plantations of Virginia, and her ultimate redemption and prosperity in the new World.\nBorn to a petty thief in London's notorious Newgate prison and determined to make her way in a rapacious and materialistic society, Moll Flanders recounts the \"fortunes and misfortunes\" of her turbulent life in this 1722 novel. Though Moll Flanders was shaped by the conventions of criminal biography, Defoe also drew on other literary traditions and his own rich background to create a remarkably original - and still controversial - work.\" In addition to a critical introduction and substantial footnotes, this Broadview edition provides a wide range of writings by Defoe as well as contemporary responses to Moll Flanders. Other appendices include a selection of eighteenth-century writings on crime, prisons, and the Virginia colony.\nMoll Flanders is born in Newgate prison and abandoned six months later. Her drive to find a secure place in society propels her through incest, adultery, bigamy, prostitution, and a resourceful career as a thief, before she is returned to Newgate.\n",

    "author": "Nathanael West",
    "description": "The four novels gathered here constitute the complete longer works of one the most brilliant and original American writers. West’s vision of American modernity is terrifyingly comical and diagnoses the tawdriness and meretriciousness of much of American popular culture. His greatest work, Miss Lonelyhearts, which begins this collection, is unique in modern literature. It describes New York in the early years of the Great Depression through the point of view of an ‘agony aunt’ who corresponds with his suffering readers in the guise of Miss Lonelyhearts: ‘(Are you in trouble? – Do you need advice?)’. A Cool Million is, as its subtitle suggests, the ‘dismantling’ of a myth, here a caustic satire of the ‘rags to riches’ story. West’s final novel, The Day of the Locust, is a comic, yet apocalyptic account of the fantasies of 1930s Hollywood. This volume concludes with West’s parodic and surreal first venture into fiction, The Dream Life of Balso Snell.\nHenry Claridge’s introduction to this new edition of West’s fictional writings contextualises his work in the United States of the Great Depression, in his evocation of 1930s Hollywood (where he worked as a writer of screenplays), and in the larger context of his Eastern European Jewish background, and, particularly, his reading of Dostoyesvky. The text comes with extensive annotations, a note on the textual history of West’s writings, and a guide to further reading for both the student and the general reader.\n",

    "author": "Stephen King",
    "description": "At one point in this final book of the Dark Tower series, the character Stephen King (added to the plot in Song of Susannah) looks back at the preceding pages and says \"when this last book is published, the readers are going to be just wild.\" And he's not kidding. After a journey through seven books and over 20 years, King's Constant Readers finally have the conclusion they've been both eagerly awaiting and silently dreading. The tension in the Dark Tower series has built steadily from the beginning and, like in the best of King's novels, explodes into a violent, heart-tugging climax as Roland and his ka-tet finally near their goal. The body count in The Dark Tower is high. The gunslingers come out shooting and face a host of enemies, including low men, mutants, vampires, Roland's hideous quasi-offspring Mordred, and the fearsome Crimson King himself. King pushes the gross-out factor at times--Roland's lesson on tanning (no, not sun tanning) is brutal--but the magic of the series remains strong and readers will feel the pull of the Tower as strongly as ever as the story draws to a close. During this sentimental journey, King ties up loose ends left hanging from the 15 non-series novels and stories that are deeply entwined in the fabric of Mid-World through characters like Randall Flagg (The Stand and others) or Father Callahan ('Salem's Lot). When it finally arrives, the long awaited conclusion will leave King's myriad fans satisfied but wishing there were still more to come. In King's memoir On Writing, he tells of an old woman who wrote him after reading the early books in the Dark Tower series. She was dying, she said, and didn't expect to see the end of Roland's quest. Could King tell her? Does he reach the Tower? Does he save it? Sadly, King said he did not know himself, that the story was creating itself as it went along. Wherever that woman is now (the clearing at the end of the path, perhaps?), let's hope she has a copy of The Dark Tower. Surely she would agree it's been worth the wait.\n(Benjamin Reese)\n",

    "description": "Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel depicts nothing less than the great clashes between capital and labour, which arose from rapid industrialisation and problems of trade in the mid-nineteenth century. But these clashes are dramatized through personal struggles. John Barton has to reconcile his personal conscience with his socialist duty, risking his life and liberty in the process. His daughter Mary is caught between two lovers, from opposing classes - worker and manufacturer. And at the heart of the narrative lies a murder which implicates them all. Mary Barton was published in 1848, at a time of great social ferment in Europe, and it reflects its revolutionary moment through an English lens. Elizabeth Gaskell wrote her first novel about the world in which she lived - Manchester at the height of the industrial revolution. As the wife of a Unitarian minister she was solidly middle-class; but she also had close contact with the working classes around her, sympathised with them, and represented their extreme distresses in her fiction. She is radical in taking on their dialect, imagining the realities of their lives, and placing a working woman at the centre of her fiction. If to our eyes her vision remains limited, it was an honest vision, for which she was much criticised in her own time, by her own class.\n",

    "description": "Tender is the Night is a story set in the hedonistic high society of Europe during the ‘Roaring Twenties’. A wealthy schizophrenic, Nicole Warren, falls in love with Dick Diver - her psychiatrist. The resulting saga of the Divers’ troubled marriage, and their circle of friends, includes a cast of aristocratic and beautiful people, unhappy love affairs, a duel, incest, and the problems inherent in the possession of great wealth. Despite cataloguing a maelstrom of interpersonal conflict, Tender is the Night has a poignancy and warmth that springs from the quality of Fitzgerald's writing and the tragic personal experiences on which the novel is based.\nSix years separate Tender is the Night and The Last Tycoon, the novel Fitzgerald left unfinished at his death in December 1940.  Fitzgerald lived in Hollywood more or less continuously from July 1937 until his death, and a novel about the film industry at the height of 'the studio system' centred on the working life of a top producer was begun in 1939.  Even in its incomplete state The Last Tycoon remains the greatest American novel about Hollywood and contains some of Fitzgerald's most brilliant writing.\n",

Set in 1797, Billy Budd, Foretopman exploits the tension of this period during the war between England and France to create a tale of satanic treachery, tragedy and great pathos that explores human relationships and the inherently ambiguous nature of man-made justice. Tales such as Bartleby, Benito Cereno, The Lightning Rod Man, The Tartarus of Maids or I and My Chimney, show the timeless poetic power of Melville's writing as he consciously uses the disguise of allegory in various ways and to various ends.\n",

Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness.\n",

    "description": "The book begins with an enigmatic prologue which promptly sows the seeds of intrigue for the entire read. In the light of the imminent elections, President Zachary isn't looking too good in the public eye. A staunch NASA supporter, he has endorsed a series of NASA's failed missions with the tax payer's money. His nemesis, the manipulative senator Sedgewick Sexton, has used this to his utmost advantage and is basking in the good books of the people, as his intentions of abolishing NASA have been publicized. So when NASA satellites descry a high density meteorite, submerged in the Milne ice shelf and carrying fossils of extraterrestrial bugs, in the midst of this political unrest, the miraculous find seems to be a ploy to secure the incumbent president a second term in the White House. The president personally requests Rachel from the NRO (coincidentally also the estranged daughter of Senator Sexton), to accompany a team of eminent civilian scientists to authenticate NASA's claim. When Michael Tollan, the renowned oceanographer, astrophysicist Corky Marlinson, glaciologist Nora Mangor, paleontologist Wailee Ming, and Rachel Sexton arrive at their destination and examine the fossils, everything seems bona fide and a spirit of victory sets in as the President is informed.\n",

Amid the horror of labour in the sub-zero work camp, we hear the stories of the prisoners, and live through the freezing isolation and pain of day after day of misery. We see a young intellectual forced to live, eat and sleep with men from a background of cruelty, coarseness and brutality.\nThe Gambler is set in a spa town with its casino and international client. Alexey Ivanovitch is a young tutor in the household of a general. He is both observer and actor in the tempest which surrounds his impoverished employer, as he envies and mocks the airs and pretensions of his supposed superiors.

Initially, the narrative centres on Soames Forsyte - a successful solicitor living in London with his beautiful wife Irene.\nA pillar of the late Victorian upper middle class, materially wealthy, his appears to be a golden existence endowed with all the necessary possessions for a 'Man of Property', but beneath this very proper exterior lies a core of unhappiness and brutal relationships. The marriage of Soames and Irene disintegrates in bitter recrimination, creating a feud within the family that will have far-reaching consequences.\n",

A wish to leave small group of violent revolutionaries, from which he had become alienated. Dostoevsky takes this real-life catastrophe as the subject and culmination of Devils, a title that refers the young radicals themselves and also to the materialistic ideas that possessed the minds of many thinking people Russian society at the time. The satirical portraits of the revolutionaries, with their naivety, ludicrous single-mindedness and readiness for murder and destruction, might seem exaggerated - until we consider their all-too-recognisable descendants in the real world ever since. The key figure in the novel, however, is beyond politics. Nikolay Stavrogin, another product of rationalism run wild, exercises his charisma with ruthless authority and total amorality. His unhappiness is accounted for when he confesses to a ghastly sexual crime - in a chapter long suppressed by the censor. This prophetic account of modern morals and politics, with its fifty-odd characters, amazing events and challenging ideas, is seen by some critics as Dostoevskys masterpiece.\n",

Some thirty-five years on, the bonds of comradeship are under strain as they end up on different sides in a power struggle that may undermine the young Louis XIV and change the face of the French monarchy.\nIn the fast-paced narrative style that was his trademark, Dumas pitches us straight into the action. What is the secret shared by Aramis and Madame de Chevreuse? Why does the Queen Mother fear its revelation? Who is the mysterious prisoner in the Bastille? And what is the nature of the threat he poses?

Old Martin Chuzzlewit, tormented by the greed and selfishness of his family, effectively drives his grandson, young Martin, to undertake a voyage to America. It is a voyage which will have crucial consequences not only for young Martin, but also for his grandfather and his grandfather's servant, Mary Graham with whom young Martin is in love. The commercial swindle of the Anglo-Bengalee company and the fraudulent Eden Land Corporation have a topicality in our own time. This strong sub-plot shows evidence of Dickens' mastery of crime where characters such as the criminal Jonas Chuzzlewit, the old nurse Mrs Gamp, and the arch-hypocrite Seth Pecksniff are the equal to any in his other great novels. Generations of readers have also delighted in Dickens' wonderful description of the London boarding-house - Todgers\n",

    "description": "Starred Review. Klutzy bounty hunter Stephanie Plum teams up with mysterious Diesel and the monkey left on her doorstep to track down a nerdy genius and his sinister business partner in the depths of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Lorelei King does her usual superlative job for the Evanovich oeuvre, adding juice and dimension to each wacky character. She deftly handles everyone, from bail bond receptionist Connie's classic New Jersey accent and outrageous sidekick Lula's brash outbursts to Ranger's smooth purr (it's amazing how he, as voiced by King, can make the word babe mean so many different things). The structures of Plum novels tend to be similar; it's the laughs that keep readers coming back. King enhances the humor of this series, so much so that Evanovich fans should consider putting down that book and plugging in the CD player instead. A St. Martin's Press hardcover (reviewed online). (Jan.) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\nFrom Booklist\nThose who know and love Stephanie, Ranger, Morelli, Lula, Bob the dog, Rex the hamster, and the rest of that wacky crew in Evanovich’s Trenton-set series, have also clasped Diesel, who appears only in these “between-the-numbers” tales, to their collective hearts. Big, blond, dimpled, and paranormal, he flits into Steph’s bail-bondswoman life with unnerving irregularity, and he has special powers that extend well beyond bounty hunting. This time Diesel has a cousin named Wulf, pale, black-clad, and dead-eyed, who has hidden a nerdy scientist and a lot of equipment in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The repartee sparkles and shimmies from razor wit to toilet humor (and back again), and the plot involves mud, food tossing, explosive farts, occasional kissing, and hilarious (and true-to-life, alas) allergic reactions (that would be from Lula). A group of monkeys, and one in particular named Carl, figure mightily in the plot, in one instance actually making the stoic, understated Ranger burst into laughter. Don’t miss Morelli’s brother-in-law, the sly Star Trek and vampire tropes, and the Jersey Devil. Incredible amounts of fun. --GraceAnne A. DeCandido\n",

    "description": "There are very few Vietnamese novels that have ever been translated into English. This beautiful romance novel, however, is so charming that it deserves to be made available for English speaking people all around the world. It is a best-seller in its original Vietnamese language, and it has been enjoyed by both the young Vietnamese readers for whom it was intended, and by their parents. The novel is far more than a simple love story. It is a motivational work which demonstrates to the Vietnamese youth that they can achieve their dreams as they strive for a better life in their rapidly growing economic society.\nThe author, Duong Thuy, has traveled and studied abroad in Europe for many years and is well educated and versed in many cultures other than her native Vietnam. She has used her experiences to spin this wonderful tale of the trials, successes and romances of a young Vietnamese girl, Kim, who travels to England to study at Oxford University. For the English reader the novel offers, not only a captivating romance portraying young love between different cultures, but also a broad perspective of the cultural, economic and social issues currently facing modern day Vietnam. For this reason the book will be of interest to, not only those interested in a lovely romance story, but to enlighten readers who are interested in learning about the social and economic problems of countries around the world such as Vietnam through the eyes of a native author.\n",

Not even their worst nightmares could have prepared them for the crime scene that awaited them instead. Brutally murdered in her bedroom, Deena's body showed signs of trauma that horrified even the toughest of cops; including our own Lieutenant Eve Dallas, who was specifically requested by the captain to investigate. When the evidence starts to pile up, Dallas and her team think they are about to arrest their perpetrator; little do they know yet that someone has gone to great lengths to tease and taunt them by using a variety of identities. Overconfidence can lead to careless mistakes. But for Dallas, one mistake might be all she needs to bring justice.\n",

The killer was never found, and the case turned cold, filed among the unsolved drive-bys in D.C.'s rough neighborhoods.\nYears later, still haunted by his wife's death, Cross is making a bold move in his life. Now a free agent from the police and the FBI, he's set up practice as a psychologist once again. His life with Nana Mama, Damon, Jannie, and little Alex is finally getting in order. He even has a chance at a new love.\nThen Cross's former partner, John Sampson, calls in a favor. He is tracking a serial rapist in Georgetown, one whose brutal modus operandi recalls a case Sampson and Cross worked together years earlier. When the case reveals a connection to Maria's death, Cross latches on for the most urgent and terrifying ride of his life.\nFrom the man USA TODAY has called the \"master of the genre,\" CROSS is the high-velocity thriller James Patterson and Alex Cross's fans have waited years to read--and the pinnacle of the bestselling detective series of the past two decades.\n",

    "description": "In what may be her most unsettling novel to date, Sue Grafton's T is for Trespass is also her most direct confrontation with the forces of evil. Beginning slowly with the day-to-day life of a private eye, Grafton suddenly shifts from the voice of Kinsey Millhone to that of Solana Rojas, introducing readers to a chilling sociopath. Rojas is not her birth name. It is an identity she cunningly stole, an identity that gives her access to private caregiving jobs. The true horror of the novel builds with excruciating tension as the reader foresees the awfulness that lies ahead. The suspense lies in whether Millhone will realize what is happening in time to intervene.\nThough set in the late eighties, T is for Trespass could not be more topical: identity theft; elder abuse; betrayal of trust; the breakdown in the institutions charged with caring for the weak and the dependent. It reveals a terrifying but all-too-real rip in the social fabric. Once again, Grafton opens up new territory with startling results.\n",

    "description": "Eve soon determines that Foster's homemade lunch was tainted with deadly ricin, and that Mr. Foster's colleagues have some startling secrets of their own. It's Eve's job to sort it out- and discover why someone would have done this to a man who seemed so inoffensive, so pleasant . . . so innocent.\nNow Magdalena Percell . . . there's someone Eve can picture as a murder victim. Possibly at Eve's own hands. The slinky blonde-an old flame of her billionaire husband, Roarke-has arrived in New York, and she's anything but innocent. Roarke seems blind to Magdalena's manipulation, and he insists that the occasional lunch or business meeting with her is nothing to worry about . . . and none of Eve's business. Eve's so unnerved by the situation that she finds it hard to focus on her case. Still, she'll have to put aside her feelings, for a while at least-because another man has just turned up dead.\nEve knows all too well that innocence can be a facade. Keeping that in mind may help her solve this case at last. But it may also tear apart her marriage.\n",

Familiar with his methods, Eve knows that he has already grabbed his next victim. Time is running out on another woman's life.\nAnd chances are he's working up to the biggest challenge of his illustrious career-abducting a woman who will test his skills and who promises to give him days and days of pleasure before she dies: Eve.\n",

    "description": "Calling T is for Trespass \"taut, terrifying, transfixing and terrific,\" USA Today went on to ask, \"What does it take to write twenty novels about the same character and manage to create a fresh, genre-bending novel every time?\" It's a question worth pondering. Through twenty excursions into the dark side of the human soul, Sue Grafton has never written the same book twice. And so it is with this, her twenty-first. Once again, she breaks genre formulas, giving us a twisting, complex, surprise-filled, and totally satisfying thriller. It's April, 1988, a month before Kinsey Millhone's thirty-eighth birthday, and she's alone in her office doing paperwork when a young man arrives unannounced. He has a preppy air about him and looks as if he'd be carded if he tried to buy booze, but Michael Sutton is twenty-seven, an unemployed college dropout. Twenty-one years earlier, a four-year-old girl disappeared. A recent reference to her kidnapping has triggered a flood of memories. Sutton now believes he stumbled on her lonely burial when he was six years old. He wants Kinsey's help in locating the child's remains and finding the men who killed her. It's a long shot but he's willing to pay cash up front, and Kinsey agrees to give him one day. As her investigation unfolds, she discovers Michael Sutton has an uneasy relationship with the truth. In essence, he's the boy who cried wolf. Is his current story true or simply one more in a long line of fabrications? Grafton moves the narrative between the eighties and the sixties, changing points of view, building multiple subplots, and creating memorable characters. Gradually, we see how they all connect. But at the beating center of the novel is Kinsey Millhone, sharp-tongued, observant, a loner-\"a heroine,\" said The New York Times Book Review, \"with foibles you can laugh at and faults you can forgive.\"\n",

    "description": "Bảy năm sau thành công chói lòa của Người tình (giải Goncourt 1984), Marguerite Duras viết lại một lần nữa câu chuyện tình giữa cô bé da trắng và người Hoa. Ở trang mở đầu Người tình Hoa Bắc, bà nói “Lẽ ra cuốn truyện có thể mang tên: Người tình trên phố hoặc Tiểu thuyết về người tình hoặc Truyện Người tình viết lại. Cuối cùng người ta đã lựa chọn giữa cái tựa rộng hơn, thực hơn: Người tình Hoa Bắc”.Tuy diễn biến tình tiết không thay đổi, song phương thức tự sự của Người tình Hoa Bắc có những nét mới. Chuyện được kể ở ngôi thứ ba, từ điểm nhìn không phải của các nhân vật, cũng không hẳn của người phụ nữ thuật chuyện, mà của một cái “ta” trung tính, từ con mắt của máy quay phim. Tác phẩm mang tính chất kép, như nhà văn xác định: “Đây là một cuốn sách. Đây là một bộ phim”.\nĐối thoại có vị trí rất lớn, sự trao đổi những lời lẽ vắn tắt, đứt quãng, như thăm dò, như khám phá các nẻo đường, các ngõ cụt, trong giao tiếp của con người, nhân vật tự bộc lộ qua những điều nói lên, và không nói lên. Nếu như Người tình lôi cuốn độc giả bằng giọng điệu tâm sự, hơi thở sâu lắng của một thứ văn xuôi tinh tế “không giống bất kỳ một văn xuôi nào khác” thì Người tình Hoa Bắc, với dáng dấp một kịch bản điện ảnh, lại gây kinh ngạc bởi sự tỉnh lược, cô đọng, bởi cách viết ngắn gọn, đi tới “tối thiểu”.\nTrong sự thể hiện nhân vật, cũng có những nét mới. Thanh, người được nhà văn đề tặng tác phẩm, không có mặt trong Người tình - giống như cô gái Alice. Người Hoa, một trong hai nhân vật chính, khác nhân vật của Người tình, anh “táo bạo hơn”, “tuấn tú hơn, khỏe mạnh hơn”. Quan hệ của anh với gia đình cô bé không giống như trong Người tình, ở đây không phải người anh cả không thèm biết đến sự tồn tại của người Hoa và áp đặt cách đối xử đó cho tất cả những người khác, mà ngược lại, chính người Hoa nhiều lần coi như không có người anh cả. Anh giành được thiện cảm của bà mẹ, của Thanh, không chỉ do tiền bạc, mà bởi chính con người anh. Cô bé sớm cảm nhận và từng nói lên tình yêu của cô với anh, không giống như trong Người tình, chỉ đến giây phút chia lìa mới thấy được sự tồn tại của tình yêu ấy.\nKhác biệt xiết bao so với nhân vật Jo trong Một con đập ngăn Thái Bình Dương (1950), anh chàng da trắng xấu xí, thảm hại, chỉ thu hút sự quan tâm của Suzanne và gia đình cô bé vì lý do kinh tế đơn thuần. Và nếu ngược lên đến hình ảnh Léo trong nhật ký những năm 40 của Marguerite Donnadieu, gã bản xứ “xấu xí rõ rệt hơn một người An Nam trung bình” mà cái hôn trộm khiến cô ghê tởm đến nỗi “khạc nhổ không ngừng, khạc nhổ suốt đêm”, thì Người tình Hoa Bắc, xuất hiện sau nửa thế kỷ, quả là một dị bản hoàn thiện, và tương phản trọn vẹn. Thế nhưng người Hoa có tồn tại thực hay không? Và nếu như ở Sa Đéc ngôi mộ của người Hoa họ Huỳnh còn đó, thì liệu có tồn tại chăng câu chuyện tình với cô bé da trắng, hay với bà mẹ của cô, như một số người gợi ý? Không thể đưa ra một khẳng định nào, bởi với Marguerite Duras, sự thực cao nhất, duy nhất đáng kể, chính là sự thực văn chương, nhà văn đồng nhất hóa mình với tác phẩm đến mức không còn biết điều gì là tự thuật và điều gì là hư cấu.\nĐiều lay động ta khi đọc và ám ảnh ta lâu dài sau đó, chính là sức mạnh mê hoặc của những chủ đề trở đi trở lại, quấn quýt lấy nhau, xuyên qua toàn bộ sáng tác của nhà văn: ham muốn, tình yêu, cái chết. Riêng với độc giả Việt Nam, sức hấp dẫn không cưỡng nổi còn từ vẻ đẹp của những đêm mùa khô, của những cơn mưa gió mùa, của mênh mang đồng ruộng, của xóm ghe thuyền, của bầy trẻ đánh xe trâu, những hình ảnh vừa huyền ảo, vừa rất thực, rất sống động, của mảnh đất phương Nam… Nhục cảm, tình yêu, sự dâng hiến và cả những đau thương chói sáng, tất cả những yếu tố đã làm nên một Marguerite Duras mê hoặc đều hiện diện trong Người tình Hoa Bắc, cuốn sách “3 in 1” vừa là một kịch bản điện ảnh vừa như một tự truyện và trên hết là một tiểu thuyết tràn đầy xúc cảm.\n",

Giữa vô vàn những hành khách lên rồi xuống xe, tìm được ai là người có thể đồng hành cùng ta trong quãng đường cao tốc dài dằng dặc của chính mình? Không phải ai đến cũng là để ở lại. Chỉ sợ ta không nhận ra người xứng đáng ở lại mà thôi. Người ta có nhau thì khó, chứ lạc mất nhau lại quá dễ dàng.\nCuốn sách này gửi đến bạn, chỉ để mong ai đọc nó cũng đều thấy lại một phần tuổi trẻ của mình cho dù nó đã đi qua, đã vỡ tan từng mảnh một. Bạn có thể bắt gặp lại chính mình, bắt gặp những cảm xúc đã từng trải qua, những cảnh vật, những con người đâu đó đã gặp, đã lướt qua nhau hay thân thiết gắn bó. Từng câu chuyện là những thanh âm trong trẻ của một vùng kí ức thanh xuân, nơi ai ai cũng đã từng sống một thời sáng trong, ngây ngô, và dại khờ.\nCuốn sách đã nhận được rất nhiều sự yêu thích của độc giả:\n“Tôi thích Mẫn ngay từ lần đầu tiên tôi đọc Người đi bán nắng. Cuốn sách như ghi lại một phần cuộc đời tôi vậy. Lời văn nhẹ nhàng, trong sáng, dễ đi vào lòng người. Mỗi câu chuyện đều để lại trong tôi những suy tư, cảm xúc mà tôi phải trầm tĩnh lắm mới giải thích được. (Độc giả Phan Bảo Trân, Bình Dương).Đọc tác phẩm, tôi như đi lạc vào một nơi nào đó khác lạ mà rất đỗi thấy thân quen . Giọng văn rất cuốn hút và có chút gì đó chợt buồn, có chút mềm lòng như những cô gái tuổi đôi mươi đang tuổi thanh xuân nhưng đã từng trải qua những buồn, vui, đã từng yêu và được yêu, đã từng hạnh phúc. Người đi bán nắng \"mong kiếm chút gì mua lại những cơn mưa\" thật sự rất xúc động và mở ra một chân trời mới cho độc giả, trong đó có tôi, nghĩ ra xa hơn. Kết thúc cuốn sách, âm hưởng của nó vẫn còn trong tôi ... Và tôi thấy mãn nguyện khi đọc cuốn sách này...\"\n(Độc giả Phùng Thanh Huy, TP HCM)\n\"Câu chuyện mang rất nhiều cảm xúc lẫn lộn với nhau hạnh phúc, đau buồn, lạnh giá...Từng câu chuyện viết lên các số phận khác nhau nhưng đều có chung một thứ đó là mạnh mẽ....Mạnh mẽ đứng lên đi tiếp sau cơn giông, mạnh mẽ đón nhận những thứ có lẽ sẽ làm mình tổn thương sau này nhưng tìm được niềm vui, hạnh phúc; mạnh mẽ đối mặt với mọi khó khăn gian khổ;...Câu chuyện như nói về gia đình mình vậy. Sau khi đọc xong mà mình khóc không ngưng được bởi vì câu chuyện miêu tả quá đúng với tâm trạng mình.\"\n(Độc giả Trần Thu Thảo, Hải Phòng)\n",

Nhưng vì danh tiếng và kinh nghiệm chiến đấu trong rừng rậm của mình mà anh bị kéo ra khỏi nơi ẩn nấp, chỉ để giải cứu Priscilla Jane Hamilton Greer, một tiểu thư giàu có vô tình dính líu đến cuộn phim chứa đựng bí mật quốc gia và bị mọi bè phái phản động các nước săn đuổi, để rồi bị bắt cóc đến Costa Rica. Một quý cô xinh đẹp đủ thông minh và can đảm để tự mình lên kế hoạch bỏ trốn. Cô theo Grant băng qua cả khu rừng rậm Costa Rica mà không hề than thở một lời nào dù có nguy hiểm hay đau đớn đến đâu chăng nữa. Một cách tự nhiên, cô đưa anh bạn đồng hành bất đắc dĩ của mình đi từ những bất ngờ này đến những kinh ngạc khác.\nNhiệm vụ mang Jane về nhà cũng chính vì những điều đó mà trở nên vô cùng thử thách, đầy màu sắc và nóng bỏng khác thường. Liệu Grant có thể quay về nông trại của mình với cuộc sống đơn độc, và những ngày tháng êm ả trôi qua sau khi đã gặp Jane?\n",

    "description": "Từ một chuyên mục trên trang văn hóa giải trí của báo Thanh Niên Online, May đã thu hút được rất nhiều độc giả nhờ ngòi bút sắc sảo và những quan điểm mới mẻ về tình yêu của mình. Rất nhiều người yêu quý May, và sự thành công của cuốn sách Blog của May - Đừng chỉ hôn lên môi ra mắt độc giả vào năm 2014 có thể coi là một minh chứng cụ thể cho điều ấy. Được mệnh danh là cây viết trẻ dành cho phái đẹp, thể hiện một cách sâu sắc những vấn đề về tình yêu, về phái yếu, nhận được rất nhiều sự đồng cảm của độc giả. Điều đặc biệt là những vấn đề ấy thường được May nhìn nhận một cách rất thẳng thắn mà không kém phần mới mẻ, hiện đại, thậm chí là táo bạo. Từ những vấn đề về sex, cuộc sống hôn nhân, quan niệm về người phụ nữ đảm đang, việc yêu người đã có vợ cho đến những “nhân sinh quan” cá nhân khi nhìn về cuộc đời, tình người theo một cách rất riêng, rất May.\nBlog của May - Anh là gia vị đời em tiếp nối sự thành công của cuốn sách đầu tiên, tiếp tục là người bạn thân thiết với độc giả, không chỉ dành cho những người phụ nữ mạnh mẽ, dám yêu, dám sống, cho những người mới yêu còn rụt rè, nhút nhát, hay cho những ai quan tâm đến phụ nữ, mà còn dành cho những người chồng, người bạn trai muốn hiểu và chia sẻ rõ hơn với vợ/người yêu mình.\nTại sao “anh” lại không phải là món chính, món phụ trong cuộc đời “em”, mà “anh” lại là gia vị? “Anh là tất cả của đời em”, “Em không sống nổi nếu thiếu anh” nghe thật vĩ đại nhường nào, nhưng có lẽ càng lớn, người ta càng chẳng muốn nói nhiều những điều to tát.\nTrích đoạn\n\"Với em, anh là gia vị, một gia vị đặc biệt mà em luôn cần có ở bên, rắc một chút, nêm nếm một chút vào mỗi khoảnh khắc em có mặt trên đời, kể từ khi anh xuất hiện.\nTình yêu không phải là tất cả, nhưng tình yêu có ở trong tất cả.\nÔi cái sự “ghen” chẳng chừa một ai đâu. Trừ phi, bạn chẳng hề yêu người ấy…\nKết thúc một tình yêu? Ai đau hơn ai? Tôi vô cùng ghét luận điệu của đàn ông, rằng “em mạnh mẽ mà”, nó cứ như thể anh muốn nói toạc ra rằng: “Em đã từng đi qua đổ vỡ, nên một lần đổ vỡ nữa cũng không giết chết được em”. Chẳng đổ vỡ nào giết chết một người phụ nữ mạnh mẽ, nhưng chính sự vô tình của đàn ông sẽ có thể giết chết phần niềm tin cuối cùng còn sót lại mà cô ấy đã dốc sức đổ ra vì anh.\nChia tay vẫn là chia tay. Anh đã đường hoàng bước vào trái tim một người phụ nữ, thì hãy ra đi một cách đường hoàng.\"\n",

    "description": "Alice Munro viết về đời sống những người bình thường với ngôn ngữ giản dị, trong trẻo, đẹp. Truyện của Munro phát triển qua một thời gian dài, tuy vậy khác với nghệ thuật tiểu thuyết, sức mạnh của bà nằm ở các mối tương quan trong cùng một thời gian, như trong một bức tranh. Bà nhìn thấy các nhân vật trong những chớp sáng của đời họ, tức là trên những khúc quanh của số phận. Vì vậy truyện ngắn của bà, tuy dài, gần như một loại tiểu thuyết ngắn, được viết với ngôn ngữ chân phương nhưng tinh tế, tinh tế nhưng không hiền lành, thực ra phần nào gần với ngôn ngữ thơ ca.\nCuốn sách gồm những truyện ngắn:\nVề đâu\nThị trấn bạch dương\nLi hương\nSỏi đá\nTổ ấm\nLòng kiêu hãnh\nNgười tình\nXe lửa\nThấp thoáng mặt hồ\nDolly\nCon mắt\nĐêm\nGiọng nói\nCuộc đời yêu dấu.\n",

Họ gặp gỡ nhau như vậy. Mạc Tang giống quả bom nguy hiểm, thậm chí có vết thương do súng mà người bình thường khó có thể hiểu được. Cô loạng choạng đến trong cơn mưa xối xả. Khi tỉnh dậy, Mạc Tang vẫn cho rằng đây chỉ là một sự cố bất ngờ.\nĐáng tiếc là rất lâu sau đó, Mạc Tang thường nghĩ lại, cuộc gặp gỡ phải gọi là thật thảm hại. Nếu còn có cơ hội, cô ước ao được giống như Daisy nói, phụ nữ nên đứng giữa nắng rực rỡ và làm nữ hoàng của thế giới. Như thế khi gặp Đường Tụng, cô mới có thể là người con gái ngoan hiền, xinh đẹp lộng lẫy.\nAi cũng có cơ hội đó, chỉ riêng Mạc Tang từ trước đến nay chưa bao giờ là cô gái ngoan hiền.\nKhi gặp Đường Tụng, Mạc Tang ngọc nát hoa tàn.\n",

Nhưng càng ghép càng thấy tổn thương. Chúng ta rồi sẽ ổn thôi viết về những câu chuyện, những mối tình dở dang như thế. Đó là tình yêu của tuổi trẻ, của sự ngơ dại, sự đĩnh đạc tình trường… Đó là những lời nói dối yêu thương trong vô thức, sự hi sinh không điểm cuối của người đàn bà, là câu chuyện về những “người cũ - người mới”, là những yêu thương chẳng có giới hạn bao giờ.\nĐể rồi, khi ta đi qua từng bước, từng bậc trên chặng đường dài của cuộc sống, bước qua tất cả những xước xát của tình yêu, lúc ấy mới có thể hiểu yêu thương mình, nuôi giữ ước mơ của chính mình mới là thứ cần yêu hơn bất cứ người đàn ông nào cả.\n\"Chúng ta rồi sẽ ổn thôi\", hãy tin rằng như thế. Vì cuộc sống này đâu chỉ có những nỗi buồn. Ngoài kia mặt trời vẫn chiếu những tia nắng mới. Ngoài kia, chim vẫn hót véo von cho một ngày nắng đẹp. Ngoài kia, có nhiều con đường để lựa chọn, nhiều niềm vui để tận hưởng hết. Ngoài kia, cuộc đời vẫn đang gọi bằng những tiếng gọi yêu thương...\nNhớ nhé, sống trọn cho mình từng phút giây mình đang có để còn thấy đời tươi đẹp lắm, đáng tận hưởng lắm. Và tin rằng: Yêu thương là một hành trình, dù đích đến là gì thì nó vẫn là một hành trình đáng nhớ. Chuyện chia tay cũng chỉ là biến cố nhỏ trong vô vàn những điều vạn biến trong cuộc đời này.\nQuan trọng là hãy bước đi và cứ bước đi: “Chúng ta rồi sẽ ổn thôi!”\n\nTrích đoạn\n\"Có mấy người có thể có tình yêu đầu đời và rồi trở thành bạn đời, có mấy người có thể nói mình chưa bao giờ đau khổ trong chuyện tình cảm? Ai cũng tỏ ra rằng mình mạnh, rằng mình chẳng sao cả, nhưng có mấy khi mọi thứ trên cuộc đời này giống như vẻ bề ngoài? Quả khó lắm! Ai rồi cũng sẽ đôi lần phải chẹp miệng:  “giá như...”.  Giá như quyển sách nào cũng hấp dẫn như cái bìa của nó, bộ phim nào cũng tuyệt vời không kém những trailer, món đồ mua online nào cũng lung linh như trên quảng cáo và đời người đoạn nào cũng đẹp như lúc mới yêu nhau.\nThế nhưng tất cả không phải một đoạn text được gõ trên máy tính: thích thì xóa đi sửa lại, muốn thì tô mầu đổi font thay chữ. Đời người giống như cuộn băng xem một lần, mỗi tình tiết đều đáng giá, đều quan trọng, không có nút tua lại, cũng không chỉnh được các hiệu ứng đặc biệt, chúng ta sẽ phải chấp nhận mọi quyết định đã đưa ra.\"\n(Minh Nhật)\n\"Trên đời có những thứ gọi là hy sinh, nhưng hy sinh ấy chưa chắc đã là xấu. Mặc dù vẫn biết rằng, có những hy sinh giống như là bị áp đặt, bắt ép, hết sức cay đắng, quá mức tủi hờn, điều đó hẳn nhiên cần phải loại bỏ.\nNhưng vẫn còn đó những hy sinh rất khác, như tôi bây giờ, hy sinh một số thứ, để thấy mình hạnh phúc hơn. Hy sinh tham vọng tưởng chừng như to lớn, để an yên với cuộc đời nhỏ bé nằm chặt trong vòng tay yêu thương của gia đình mà mình cùng chồng con vun đắp. Chẳng phải đặt trong một số hoàn cảnh, “hy sinh” là sự trao đổi tuyệt vời, không chút sân si, tị niềm, hơn thiệt đó sao? Cảm giác như  giống là, mình xuống đường không bằng ai, nhưng về nhà, không ai bằng mình. Mọi so sánh bấp bênh với đời, đều trở nên khập khiễng.\nPhụ nữ, cần dịu dàng thôi là hạnh phúc rồi, với tôi, giờ phút này là thế đó.\"\n(Gào)\n",

Nàng - Xtefchia Ruđexka - chỉ là con gái một điền chủ nhỏ, thất vọng vì mối tình đã rời gia đình đến làm gia sư cho cô ruột của chàng. Cảm vì sắc, mến vì tài, lại mang trong tâm thức niềm khao khát của cuộc tình truyền kiếp bất hạnh từ đời trước (ông nội của chàng và bà ngoại của nàng từng yêu tha thiết nhưng không lấy được nhau), đôi trẻ đã vượt qua những hiểu lầm đầu tiên, cảm nhận được giá trị đích thực của nhau và đến với nhau. Trải qua bao đấu tranh gay go, với gia đình, xã hội và với chính mình để bảo vệ tình yêu, tình yêu của họ đã thắng: họ được làm lễ đính ước và chuẩn bị cho ngày cưới.\nNhưng giới quí tộc không cam chịu thất bại, chúng đã hèn hạ dùng những thủ đoạn thâm hiểm để phá vỡ hạnh phúc đôi trẻ. Xtefchia gục ngã trước ngón đòn đê hèn ấy vào đúng ngày hôn lễ được ấn định, trong tấm áo cưới trắng tinh như tâm hồn trinh bạch và cao quí của nàng. Nàng đã chết để cho tình yêu thắng, như nhân ái vĩnh viễn chiến thắng cái ác trên cõi đời này. Nhiều người coi Con Hủi là một thiên Romeo và Juliet mới, là bi kịch đối kháng giữa tình cảm chân chính với những định kiến xã hội hẹp hòi. Nhưng trên hết, Con Hủi là tác phẩm ca ngợi tình yêu - một tình yêu khó khăn và hoàn mỹ, một tình yêu đích thực và lý tưởng, có sức cuốn hút đến kỳ lạ, niềm khát vọng vĩnh viễn của con người.\nCó phải vì thế mà mặc dù đã 90 năm trôi qua với bao biến đổi biển dâu về nhân tình thế thái, quan niệm xã hội và ngay chính bản thân tình yêu cũng đã đổi thay, nhưng Con Hủi vẫn có chỗ đứng trong trái tim người đọc, nhất là bạn đọc trẻ. Có phải vì thế mà mặc dù người đọc thời nay dễ dàng nhận ra những nét ngây thơ và lý tưởng hóa trong câu chuyện tình của đôi thanh niên thời đầu thế kỷ, Con Hủi vẫn đánh thức bao hoài vọng, bao khao khát cao quí, muốn được sống hết mình, được yêu hết mình, và khi cần - được hy sinh cho tình yêu ấy. Người đọc - đặc biệt là các thiếu nữ nói chung - hâm mộ tác phẩm đến mức cuồng nhiệt, nhiều thế hệ \"phái đẹp\" coi nó là một tác phẩm hay nhất, là sách gối đầu giường, là đỉnh cao của những niềm hy vọng và mơ ước...\n",

    "description": "Vào năm 646, ngài Huyền Trang, vị cao tăng đời Đường, đã căn cứ theo lộ trình Tây du của mình, viết nên quyển \"Đại Đường Tây Vực ký\"..., đến đời Minh, Ngô Thừa Ân đã chuyển thể từ \"Đại Đường Tây Vực ký\" thành \"Tây Du ký\". Từ đó, những câu chuyện liên quan về Đường Tăng được lưu truyền rộng rãi ở nhân gian. Thời gian cứ thế trôi qua, đến nay cũng hơn 1000 năm, một nữ sĩ Trung Quốc đã độc hành lại con đường của ngài Huyền Trang, đồng thời đem những điều trải qua viết nên quyển Muôn Dặm Không Mây bằng tiếng Anh.\nMùa hè năm 2004, tác giả đã chuyển dịch thành tác phẩm \"Vạn lý vô vân\" và xuất bản tại Trung Quốc. Ngài Huyền Trang đến Ấn Độ cầu học Phật pháp khoảng 19 năm; sau khi về nước, ngài dốc toàn lực cho sự nghiệp phiên dịch, hoằng pháp. Hơn 1300 năm trở lại đây, kinh văn đọc tụng đa phần do Ngài phiên dịch. Ngài không chỉ là một vị cao tăng, mà còn là sứ giả văn hóa, nhà du hành vĩ đại. Lỗ Tấn, tác giả nổi tiếng của Trung Quốc đầu thế kỷ 20, xưng tụng ngài là \"Bậc đống lương của dân tộc\"..., Lương Khải Siêu cũng tôn Ngài là \"Thiên cổ nhất nhân\", từ đó có thể thấy địa vị quan trọng của Ngài trong lịch sử Trung Quốc.\nMột phụ nữ Trung Quốc, cô thân vạn lý tìm hiểu hành trình của bậc cao tăng cách nay hơn 1000 năm. Quyển sách đã làm chấn động giới học giả năm châu, đây cũng là đề tài gây chú ý cho các nhà xuất bản tại Trung Quốc. Tiến sĩ Amartya Sen - người từng được giải thưởng Nobel về kinh tế học, trong lời đề tựa cho bản dịch Trung Quốc của mình nói: \"Đây là quyển sách đa tầng mức, đa góc độ, cũng là một tuyệt phẩm bao hàm văn hóa, lịch sử, địa lý và nhân văn...\".\nĐây là bộ sách dùng tâm để thể nghiệm. Tác giả đã dùng lối diễn đạt chân thật, sinh động, tư tưởng sâu sắc, kết hợp với rất nhiều hình ảnh đẹp trong lộ trình của mình, nhận thức nền văn minh tiên tiến và cổ xưa, nâng cao vị trí văn hóa Trung Quốc trong con mắt của mọi người trên thế giới, thẳng tiến vào thế giới tinh thần uyên bác của ngài Huyền Trang, lãnh ngộ được chân đế Phật giáo.\n",

Mức độ làm chủ và gắn kết với sự tổn thương của bản thân sẽ quyết định độ sâu của lòng dũng cảm và sự rõ ràng trong mục tiêu của chúng ta.\nNếu dành cả đời để chờ đến khi chúng ta thật hoàn hảo hay bất khả chiến bại rồi mới bước vào trận địa, thì cuối cùng, chúng ta sẽ để vuột mất các mối quan hệ và những cơ hội có một không hai, chúng ta hoang phí thời gian quý giá và quay lưng lại với những tài năng mà trời phú cho chúng ta, những đóng góp mà chỉ chúng ta mới có thể tạo ra.\nHoàn hảo và bất khả chiến bại đều là những điều rất hấp dẫn nhưng chúng không thực sự tồn tại trong cuộc sống của con người.

Những bài thơ theo từng cung bậc cảm xúc, lúc chia xa, ly biệt, khi hội ngộ tương phùng, lúc khắc khoải đầy niềm đau, lúc dấy lên niềm hi vọng... khiến cho mọi người dễ dàng đồng cảm và tìm thấy mình trong từng dòng thơ của  Ngô Võ Giang Trung.\nThôi thì\nlấy anh đi\ncó gì đâu phải nghĩ\nđể đêm về còn thủ thỉ với nhau.\nCòn trẻ gì nữa đâu\nđể yêu đương lăng nhăng vật vã\ntrước tới giờ cũng đã\ntám chục cuộc tình.\nSẽ không còn thui thủi một mình\nđi và về đong đầy nỗi nhớ\ncũng không cần kiếm cớ\nđể gần nhau\n….\n(Trích Câu Trả Lời Nằm Ở Cuộc Yêu Sau...)\nMột điều đặc biệt là 73 bài thơ đều không được tác giả đặt tên hẳn hoi, bởi theo anh \"ngôn từ đã là cứu cánh cuối cùng cho những cảm xúc ngổn ngang dâu bể, làm sao gói gọn được chúng trong đôi ba từ ngữ mong manh..\".\nThơ của Ngô Võ Giang Trung sử dụng những ngôn từ rất giản dị và mộc mạc nhưng lại mạnh mẽ, tỉnh rụi, bất cần và có cả mùi phong trần. Theo tác giả: \"… thơ là đời, là cách để giải tỏa những cảm xúc của chính mình cũng như để chia sẻ với những ai đồng điệu, vậy nên, thơ phải thật…\" Đọc Câu Trả Lời Nằm Ở Cuộc Yêu Sau như đọc những dòng viết cho chính bạn, những cảm xúc mà dường như bạn đã có lúc nhận thấy là chúng cũng từng xuất hiện trong bạn, có điều, bạn đã không ghi lại.

Mà tình thương là một chất liệu ngọt ngào, êm dịu và cố nhiên là ngon lành. Con trẻ thiếu tình thương thì không lớn lên được. Người lớn thiếu tình thương thì cũng không \"lớn\" lên được, cằn cỗi, héo mòn\". Và mẹ luôn là suối nguồn của tình yêu thương.\nNhìn thấy ai ai cũng bày tỏ \"Mùa báo hiếu\" bằng nhiều hình thức như: đi chùa, dâng hương, an chay, niệm Phật, hay cũng có thể vẫn giữ một nếp sống sinh hoạt như thường ngày,… Mỗi người một vẻ, mỗi người một trái tim, mỗi người có một tình yêu mẹ riêng nhưng có lẽ đọng lại trong tất cả chúng ta là niềm tri ân cao quý về công ơn sinh thành của bậc cha mẹ, sẽ mãi khắc sâu trong tâm trí của mỗi người. Và dù cho mãi sau, có đi đây về đâu chăng nữa, thì chúng ta vẫn biết rằng, ba mẹ vẫn mãi còn dõi theo bước con.\nMỗi độ Vu Lan về là dịp để chúng ta bày tỏ lòng biết ơn thành kính lên cha mẹ. Hãy tận dụng thời gian đừng để phải hối hận vì lòng hiếu thảo là động lực giúp gia đình hạnh phúc, đầm ấm. Đây cũng chính là mong muốn của cha ông ta ngày trước, muốn cho con cháu đời sau luôn luôn sống có nhân nghĩa biết nhớ công ơn của cha mẹ.\nBông Hồng Cài Áo gửi gắm một tấm lòng thiết tha, một món quà chứa đựng sự biết ơn mà những người làm con dành tặng cho cha mẹ. Không chỉ trong ngày lễ Vu Lan mà bất cứ lúc nào, cũng hãy nhớ đến các đấng sinh thành và thể hiện lòng biết ơn, tình thương của mình với họ.\n\"Sau khi chào đời ta có những lúc không vừa ý, nên đa số chúng ta đều cảm thấy rằng thời gian trong bụng mẹ là một thời gian tuyệt vời. Ta khỏi phải lo lắng về thức ăn thức uống. Ta được che chở khỏi nóng và lạnh. Ta khỏi làm bài tập ở nhà và công việc bếp núc. Khi được bảo vệ trong bụng mẹ ta cảm thấy an toàn. Ta khỏi phải lo lắng gì cả. Và điều đó thật là tuyệt vời. Tôi chắc rằng nhiều người trong chúng ta vẫn còn nhớ về khoảng thời gian đó.\"\n(Cung điện hài nhi)\n\"Khi bạn bước, bạn bước cho ai? Bạn có thể bước để đến một nơi chốn nào đó, nhưng bạn cũng có thể bước như một lối hiến tặng thiền tập. Thật là hiếu thảo khi bạn bước cho cha mẹ hay ông bà vì ông bà, cha mẹ có thể đã không biết thực tập bước đi trong chánh niệm. Tổ tiên bạn có thể suốt đời đã không có cơ hội bước đi trong thanh thản hạnh phúc và an trú vững chãi trong hiện tại. Thật là tội nghiệp; nhưng chúng ta không phải lặp lại tình trạng ấy.\"\n(Bước đi với đôi chân của cha mẹ)\n\"Tình thương của ta đối với mẹ có thể bị cơn giận và nỗi thất vọng chen vào. Năng lượng chánh niệm có thể giúp ta nhận diện nỗi đau của ta về cha mẹ giúp ta ôm lấy niềm đau ấy như một bà mẹ ẵm con khi con khóc. Hồi bé thơ, khi bạn khóc, chắc chắn mẹ sẽ ngưng mọi việc và ẵm bạn lên rồi ôm bạn vào lòng. Nếu mẹ không có đó thì một người khác sẽ làm thay mẹ. Khi ta nhận diện và ôm lấy nỗi đau buồn trong ta thì nỗi đau buồn đó sẽ được lắng dịu như em bé trong vòng tay của mẹ.\"\n(Sự hòa giải)\n",

Nếu như hai tập đầu tiên lấy cảm hứng từ những tiểu thuyết văn học nổi tiếng ở Nhật Bản và trên thế giới, thì tác phẩm chủ đề của tập này là Tình bạn - một vở kịch của Mushanokouji Saneatsu, xoay quanh chủ đề đấu tranh nội tâm giữa tình yêu và tình bạn. Nojima - nhân vật chính - yêu Sugiko, nhưng Sugiko lại đem lòng yêu bạn thân của anh ta, Oomiya. Oomiya tuy cũng có tình cảm với Sugiko, nhưng vì tình bạn với Nojima, anh đã quyết định sẽ kìm nén cảm xúc của mình và chúc phúc cho người bạn thân. Câu chuyện trong tác phẩm này được lồng ghép một cách khéo léo vào câu chuyện của những nhân vật trong Cô gái văn chương. Nếu như mối quan hệ giữa các nhân vật trong truyện ở các tập trước vẫn còn rời rạc thì đến tập này mọi thứ được kết nối lại. Những bí mật dần hé mở, khiến cho người đọc phải suy đoán về những diễn biến tiếp theo của series này. Cô gái văn chương và gã khờ bị trói buộc được cộng đồng đánh giá là tập có giọng văn hay nhất trong toàn series. Những câu nói của các nhân vật trong truyện được trích từ vở kịch đều rất đáng ghi nhớ, mà theo như tác giả nói thì chúng không khác gì những câu “danh ngôn”. Câu chuyện trong tập ba này nhẹ nhàng và tươi sáng hơn so với tập trước, tình tiết vô cùng lôi cuốn, hấp dẫn, đồng thời gợi ra sự tò mò cho người đọc về các tập tiếp theo.\n",

Cho dù nạn nhân đã báo cảnh sát, cảnh sát dốc lực lượng hùng hậu thiên la địa võng, đồng thời theo sát bên cạnh nạn nhân để bảo vệ. Dưới tầng tầng lớp lớp mai phục như vậy, tên sát thủ thần bí vẫn có thể giết chết được đối phương một cách vô cùng dễ dàng như trở bàn tay!\nTất cả những vụ giết chóc đều ở ngay trước mắt cảnh sát, đợt vây bắt lần nào của cảnh sát cũng đều bị thất bại thảm hại. Thế nhưng không ai hay biết được thân phận thật sự của tên sát thủ thần bí, lần nào sự bố trí tỉ mỉ cẩn trọng của cảnh sát cũng đều nằm trong kế hoạch của hắn, đây là một cuộc đối đầu đọ trí vô cùng đặc sắc. Thủ pháp gây án dường như hoàn mỹ không chút khiếm khuyết, liệu có tồn tại sơ hở nào để có thể phá án được hay không?\nMột cuộc thi đấu hấp dẫn, chắc chắn cần phải có đối thủ hùng mạnh. Anh muốn giết tôi, tôi cũng muốn giết anh - Đây chính là câu chuyện giữa cảnh sát và sát thủ!\nNhững tội nhân thoát khỏi sự khống chế của pháp luật, đều sẽ phải đón nhận sự trừng phạt của Eumenides.

Để rồi sau này khi ngẫm lại, cô thấy mình từ lúc nào đã trở thành con thiêu thân, không màng đến hết thảy mà lao vào nơi ấm áp.\n...\nSau ba năm, cuối cùng Nghiêm Kí cũng có thể ôm lấy Hạ Vũ, bao bọc cô gái đang muốn sải cánh bay cao kia vào thế giới của mình, để rồi thì thầm bên tai cô lời thề nguyền tình yêu.\n\"Hạ Vũ, em nghe này, có mấy lời anh muốn nói với em, dù muộn mất ba năm nhưng anh không thể không nói.

    "description": "Cô gái văn chương là một series light novel nổi tiếng của nữ tác giả Nomura Mizuki, một trong những hiện tượng light novel đuợc nhắc đến nhiều nhất tại Nhật Bản cũng như trên thế giới. Lượng tiêu thụ của bộ sách này lên tới vài triệu bản, những diễn đàn và cộng đồng mạng tại Nhật đánh giá nó như là một trong những series hay nhất từ trước đến giờ, đặc biệt là giải thưởng Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! danh giá của Nhật đã xếp Cô gái văn chương lên vị trí thứ 8 vào năm 2007, thứ 3 vào năm 2008 và thứ nhất vào năm 2009 trong bảng xếp hạng light novel của mình.\nAmano Tooko - nhân vật chính trong Cô gái văn chương - cũng đã đoạt giải Nhân vật nữ hay nhất của năm 2009. Bộ light novel này đã được chuyển thể thành cả truyện tranh và phim hoạt hình. Amano Tooko là một “cô gái văn chương” thích những cuốn sách đến mức muốn ăn-tươi-nuốt-sống chúng. Inoue Konoha - nam sinh học lớp dưới - mỗi ngày đều phải viết những bữa “điểm tâm” cho Tooko. Mọi chuyện bắt đầu bằng tin nhắn cầu cứu của Tooko với nội dung như sau “Chị bị kẻ xấu bắt cóc rồi. Hãy mang theo quần áo để thay và bài tập rồi đến cứu chị ngay bây giờ”. Konoha miễn cưỡng trải qua những ngày viết “điểm tâm” cho bà chị tại biệt trang nhà Himekura. Thế nhưng, cái bóng của tấn thảm kịch xảy ra từ tám mươi năm về trước đang khẽ khàng tiến về phía họ. “Tiểu thư”, “học sinh” và “yêu quái”, các diễn viên đã tập hợp đủ và đứng vào vị trí trên sân khấu, tất cả lại một lần nữa đối diện với cảnh sụp đổ hoang tàn. Maki, người sắp đặt nên tình huống này, mong muốn điều gì? “Cô gái văn chương” với tâm hồn bị xáo động bởi chính “trí tưởng tượng” của mình đang che giấu “bí mật” gì… Câu chuyện trong tập này xảy ra ngay sau tập 2, xoay quanh câu chuyện của nhà Himekura, nhưng lại có tiết lộ những gì sẽ xảy ra trong tập 7. \nDựa trên tác phẩm chủ đề Khung của hẹp của nhà văn André Gide, Cô gái văn chương và nhà văn hướng về Chúa trời đề cập đến những giằng xé nội tâm của một người theo nghiệp viết văn trước hai con đường: một con đường dẫn đến Chúa, đến nơi “chí cao” mà người đó phải một mình bước qua “khung cửa hẹp” mới có thể tới được; và một con đường dẫn đến tình yêu. Nhà văn đó đã lựa chọn thế nào? Konoha sẽ lựa chọn thế nào? Và bí mật mà Tooko vẫn hằng che giấu là gì?\nKana này, có một câu chuyện mà mình muốn viết ra.\nMột câu chuyện ngọt ngào, thanh khiết, trắng ngần tựa manna rơi xuống từ bầu trời, cứu giúp những người dân lưu lạc trên vùng đất hoang, cho dù đói tới đâu thì nó cũng có thể khiến họ cảm thấy no căng bụng.\nCho đến khi con dân của người đạt đến vùng đất hứa, Chúa sẽ tiếp tục để manna rơi xuống, cho họ thấy hi vọng, và niềm thương yêu vô hạn của người.\nKana này, mình rất hi vọng một ngày nào đó mình có thể viết ra một câu chuyện đầy dịu dàng và hạnh phúc như vậy.\nChỉ cần như vậy...\n",

    "description": "RUM - cuộc phiêu lưu của những trái tim yêu cuồng nhiệt nhưng không đơn giản.\nRUM là cuốn tiểu thuyết của những mối tình tưởng mong manh mà hóa bền chặt, tưởng yếu ớt mơ hồ lại hóa nhân duyên. Với thế giới Showbiz, mơ thành thực, thực thành mơ, những điều vô lý nhất trở thành hiển nhiên nhất, những điều hào nhoáng nhất lại tan đi trong phút chốc. Bước chân vào Rum, bạn bước chân vào thế giới ấy: Thế giới ấn chứa bao thị phi, mưu mô, dối trá. Nơi ước mơ và hoài bão phải đánh đổi bởi nhiều khi là tất cả. Những giá trị tưởng vô giá được đem ra mua bán, trao đổi. Đọc Rum, người đọc sẽ thấy ngạc nhiên và khó hiểu, sẽ phải đi đến tận cùng cuốn sách để rồi cuối cùng vỡ òa nhận ra câu trả lời cho câu hỏi.“Tại sao giữa chốn đô thị phồn hoa, nơi tiền và quyền chiếm hữu tất cả, nơi những giá trị phù phiếm lên ngôi, giữa những cám dỗ không thể chối từ đó, hai con người kia vẫn yêu nhau đến cuối cùng? Thứ tình yêu vốn mong manh ngờ đâu lại mãnh liệt đến vậy?\nTác giả đẩy các nhân vật vào bế tắc không lối thoát. Rồi lại cứu vớt họ bằng một cách không ai ngờ tới. Một Nam Kha đang trên đỉnh cao của danh vọng, biến mất sau scandal ảnh nóng. Một Louis con át chủ bài của tập đoàn giải trí, tự tử. Một Ame hồn nhiên ngây thơ, trở nên xảo quyệt toan tính. Một RUM người mang giọng hát của một vị thần. Bỗng nhiên bỏ đi không tung tích. Có lẽ đấy chính là thứ khiến độc giả bị cuốn hút bởi Ploy Ngọc Bích, cũng là cái chất đặc trưng - tạo nên RUM.\n\nVẫn là ngòi bút sắc lạnh. Vẫn là giọng văn tỉnh táo lột trần tất cả. Nhưng Ploy thôi miên người đọc bằng một cách khác. Chính là cảm giác chân thực. Chân thực đến lạ lùng trong cách xây dựng tình huống, cách phác họa hình tượng nhân vật, trong cách mô tả diễn biến tâm lý, thậm chí trong cả cách YÊU: Yêu điên cuồng! Yêu đến mất lí trí nhưng cũng đầy toan tính. Người đọc sẽ băn khoăn tự hỏi: Sau mọi lừa dối, mọi phản bội, tình yêu có đủ mạnh mẽ kéo họ lại bên nhau?\nVà RUM dành cho bạn, với những trải nghiệm cảm xúc đầy ma mị, đầy huyền bí, đầy phức tạp nhưng lại hết sức tinh tế và quyến rũ. Hãy cũng chào đón sự trở lại ấn tượng của RUM. Được Ploy Ngọc Bích nhào nặn lại. Và phù phép bởi họa sĩ Tuyệt Đỉnh Sinh Vật. \n",

Chỉ với chiếc mo cau và một thằng bạn là bạn đã có một chiếc xe kéo đến mòn mông, thủng quần. Những món đồ chơi được sản xuất từ những nguyên liệu trong vườn, trong nhà và những đứa trẻ ấy chỉ cần một thứ đồ bỏ đi cũng biến thành đạo cụ hoành tráng. Những tháng ngày ấy không âu lo, chẳng muộn phiền, chỉ có tiếng cười trong trẻo, những khuôn mặt nhọ nhem vì nghịch ngợm, mọi thứ đều kỳ diệu và dường như cả thế giới đều là của mình.\n\nQuãng thời học sinh nhất quỷ nhì ma nhiều trò chọc phá cũng thật oái oăm.

Những ký ức về cái thời ẩm ương, ngọt ngào, bình dị mà mộc mạc không thể phai nhòa trong lòng mỗi người.\nCuốn sách không chỉ là khoảng trời riêng của Táo, mà còn chứa một sắc trời xanh trong của bạn.\n\n",

    "description": "Cùng với Leonardo da Vinci và Michelangelo, Raphael là một trong những đại diện xuất sắc nhất của mỹ thuật Phục Hưng Italia đỉnh cao. Trong quãng thời gian 37 năm ngắn ngủi đời người, Raphael đã để lại cho nhân thế những kiệt tác phần lớn xoay quanh chủ đề tôn giáo và lịch sử, để nhân loại mãi tạc ghi vào ngôi đền mỹ thuật là “Thánh hội họa”, đệ nhất họa sỹ của nhà thờ Thiên Chúa giáo, tinh hoa của thời đại Phục Hưng.\nDanh họa Raphael có cuộc đính hôn đình đám với tiểu thư Maria, cô cháu gái của Giáo hoàng Vatican đầy quyền lực và danh giá bấy giờ. Song, trái tim của ông lại rung cảm mãnh liệt ở nơi nàng thơ bí ẩn Margherita, con gái của một người thợ làm bánh đến từ Siena. Hình ảnh của Margherita luôn hiện hữu trong những họa phẩm để đời về phái đẹp như Fornaria, Velata,… Ngoài vẻ kiều mị của nàng thì chi tiết viên ngọc trai đính trên chiếc khăn trùm đầu hay trâm cài ẩn hiện trong các bức tranh đều ám muội một tình yêu cháy bổng giữa danh họa và nàng thơ. Bởi lẽ, Margherita, theo tiếng Latinh, có nghĩa là “ngọc trai”.\nChuyện tình và cuộc đời lắm thăng trầm của danh họa đằng sau các bức vẽ hay những bước rong ruổi khắp mọi miền châu thành của Italia như chuyến hành hương truy tầm cái Đẹp không biết chùng mỏi đã trở thành đề tài quen thuộc trong nghệ thuật sáng tạo cổ kim. Họa sỹ Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres của Pháp ở thế kỷ XIX đã vẽ nàng thơ ngồi trên đùi của danh họa Raphael. Một thế kỷ sau, Picasso tỉ mẩn miêu tả cuộc hẹn hò của đôi tình nhân trong họa phẩm. Còn văn hào Honore de Balzac cũng đưa chuyện tình này vào tác phẩm của mình.\nThêm lần nữa, tác giả đã kỳ công “phục hưng” chuyện tình tay ba thắm đẫm dư vị hoan lạc lẫn chát đắng cách đây hàng thế kỷ nhưng vẫn thấy tươi mới như vừa xảy ra hôm qua. Chuyện tình ấy lại được đặt trên nền cảnh thành Rome hoa lệ, đâu đó thấp thoáng hình ảnh đầy khêu gợi không gian huê tình của Venice, Florence hay những châu thành khác của Italia. Với giọng văn sâu lắng, đong đầy cảm xúc, những câu chữ giàu nhịp điệu, tác giả đã khai quật những tiểu vũ trụ bí ẩn bên trong số phận hai người phụ nữ gần gụi với cuộc đời danh họa Raphael để vẽ nên bức chân dung sống động nhiều cung bậc của danh họa và của cả thời đại Phục Hưng vô tiền khoáng hậu trong lịch sử hội họa.\nCuốn tiểu thuyết ngắn này đến từ hai điểm nhìn của hai người phụ nữ khác biệt giai tầng, quan điểm giống như hai dòng chảy cùng song hành và gặp nhau trong tình yêu dành cho danh họa Raphael. Tình yêu tự đáy lòng hay tình yêu từ danh vọng, cuối cùng kiểu nào mới giữ được trái tim của người đàn ông thành Rome?\n",

    "description": "Bộ tiểu thuyết trinh thám Mười tội ác của tác giả Tri Thù điều tra về 10 vụ án kinh thiên động địa được dựa trên nguyên mẫu 10 vụ án có thật từng gây chấn động toàn Trung Quốc vừa được phát hành tại Việt Nam.\nNhân vật trong các vụ án đó là những tội phạm giết người, những kẻ biến thái chuyên hủy hoại dung nhan người khác, những hung thủ băm xác người, những con yêu râu xanh. Đọc truyện Mười tội ác của Tri Thù, bạn sẽ phát hiện con người có thể ác đến mức không cần màng đến đạo đức. Vì tiền có thể giết người, một ông chú ngoại tứ tuần, có thể làm chuyện đồi bại với những cô bé vị thành niên, giết người rồi hãm hiếp tử thi, giết người băm xác, ăn thịt người, lột da người, những kẻ hoang dâm vô độ... đủ mọi hình thái tội phạm được dần dần phơi bày trên mỗi trang sách. Đáng chú ý, Tri Thù viết về tội ác rất nhạy bén và tinh tế. Ông mô tả chi tiết nhưng không hề lên gân cốt để cố tình \"uy hiếp\" tinh thần độc giả. Dưới ngòi bút của Tri Thù, những thủ đoạn bệnh hoạn, lệch lạc, tàn nhẫn… dần dần hiện ra một cách tự nhiên, lôi cuốn người đọc.\nĐiểm hấp dẫn nhất của bộ truyện này chính là những tình tiết khiếp đảm, rùng rợn mà độc giả không thể hình dung ra nổi. Nó giống như một bộ phim kinh dị vậy, tuy người ta thấy sợ những câu chuyện máu me, tàn nhẫn, tim đập liên hồi, da đầu tê bì nhưng vẫn không thoát khỏi sự tò mò để theo dõi tiếp những diễn biến kinh hoàng sau đó.\nCuốn tiểu thuyết giúp con người nhận thức được tính nhân văn sau mỗi vụ án để hướng thiện, như tác giả từng viết “Trên thế giới không có kẻ xấu, chỉ có những người tốt trót phạm sai lầm”. Cũng chính vì thế, tuy viết truyện điều tra phá án, nhưng Tri Thù không nhấn mạnh vào quá trình đi tìm tội ác, cũng như các kỹ xảo phá án hay sự thông minh tột bậc của các cảnh sát mà đặc biệt nhấn mạnh vào nguyên nhân phạm tội.\nTập 2 bộ tiểu thuyết trinh thám Mười tội ác tiếp tục tái hiện mười vụ án có thật từng xảy ra tại Trung Quốc, tên nhân vật và địa điểm xảy ra vụ án đã được thay đổi. Những vụ án biến thái và man rợ xảy ra ngay giữa cuộc sống đời thường, nhưng do mức độ nghiêm trọng, các thông tin liên quan đến các vụ việc này đều bị phong tỏa và dần trở thành những vụ kì án. Tình tiết các vụ “thang máy có ma”, “sát thủ hoa Tường Vi”, “đứa trẻ ma”... cùng những câu chuyện từng gây sốt trên mạng khác khiến người đọc phải nổi da gà. Từng bước lần theo dấu vết, từng bước cảm nhận sự sợ hãi!\nMười tôi ác - Cuốn tiểu thuyết khiến bạn phải hét lên vì kinh hãi!\nVì sao chúng lại bạo lực như vậy? Vì sao chúng lại biến thái nhường ấy?\nSự méo mó về mặt tâm lí là bẩm sinh, hay do xã hội hiện đại gây ra?\nTìm ra chân tướng sự thực không phải mục đích cuối cùng của chúng ta.\n",

    "description": "Tiểu thuyết gửi gắm một thông điệp về tình yêu, chỉ có tình yêu trong sáng, chân thành, không vụ lợi mới khiến cho con người trở nên cao đẹp, đủ nghị lực vượt qua những bão giông của cuộc đời và cùng nhau quay về một hướng. Chính vì thế, Cây Nước Mắt đã được chuyển thể thành phim truyện truyền hình 35 tập với tựa đề gốc của tác phẩm, do Hãng phim Truyền hình TPHCM và Hãng phim Cửu Long hợp tác sản xuất, dự kiến phát sóng vào tháng 7/2015.\nCây Nước Mắt kể về chuyện tình lãng mạn, éo le giữa ông chủ người Pháp và cô phu cao su người Việt. Chuyện bắt đầu vào thời điểm những năm 40 của thế kỷ trước và kết thúc bằng thắng lợi của Cách mạng tháng Tám năm 1945.\nTác phẩm là một bức tranh hiện thực sinh động, thấm đẫm máu, nước mắt, kể về nỗi thống khổ của những phu phen cao su thời kỳ trước Cách mạng tháng Tám năm 1945. Chế độ lao động hà khắc, bị bóc lột tàn tệ, con người không khác gì con vật, có khi chỉ là thứ đồ chơi trong tay những tên chủ đốn cùng bọn xu cai tàn bạo. Nhưng nổi lên vẫn là tinh thần yêu nước, gắn kết với nhau để chiến đấu cho chính nghĩa của những phu phen trong hoàn cảnh khốn cùng ấy. Họ sẵn sàng hy sinh tất cả để hướng đến tương lai tươi sáng.\nTiểu thuyết của nhà biên kịch Huệ Ninh thể hiện cái nhìn đa chiều với hiện thực lịch sử, không cực đoan chủ nghĩa. Tác phẩm đã làm nổi bật hình tượng của lực lượng tiến bộ người Pháp, yêu chuộng hòa bình. Đó là lực lượng đối trọng với các thế lực đen tối thời bấy giờ. Khẳng định chân lý, tình yêu luôn có tiếng nói chung, bất chấp mọi ranh giới, rào cản.\nNhận định\n\"Đây là một trong số ít người trẻ viết về cuộc cách mạng Việt Nam từ trước năm 1945 đến Cách mạng tháng Tám năm 1945. Là tác phẩm văn học nghệ thuật quy mô hiếm hoi về ngành cao su Việt Nam. Là tác phẩm ít ỏi viết về tình hữu nghị Việt - Pháp, khai thác những nét văn hoá, tính cách con người Pháp\"\n(Nhà báo, nhà nhiếp ảnh Hoàng Kim Đáng)\n",

Linnea tưởng tượng mình sẽ nhận được sự chào đón nhiệt thành của Theodore, vị chủ nhà nơi cô sẽ ở. Tuy nhiên anh lại là một người đàn ông “ghét cay ghét đắng” phụ nữ.\nKhoảng cách tuổi tác giữa anh và cô khiến mối quan hệ của họ trở nên căng thẳng từng ngày. Sự ngây thơ, non nớt của Linnea hoàn toàn trái ngược với sự gai góc, từng trải của Theodore. Anh coi cô chẳng khác gì kẻ thù. Dẫu vậy, cô vẫn cố gắng thật nhiều để hiểu anh và làm bạn với anh. Cô dạy anh đọc chữ, dạy anh mở lòng, còn anh thì trốn tránh cô bằng mọi cách... Ở Alamo, những sự kiện lần lượt diễn ra đã khiến Linnea từng bước trưởng thành. Cô phải chịu đựng nỗi đau khi những người mình quen biết phải lên đường phục vụ chiến tranh, khi bão tuyết và dịch bệnh lần lượt mang những người cô yêu quý ra đi mãi mãi.\nVui vẻ, bình yên, mệt mỏi, cay đắng, từng cung bậc cảm xúc đánh ập vào cô và cuốn cô vào cuộc sống ở đó. Rồi chẳng biết tự khi nào, Linnea Brandonberg quyết định rằng mình vĩnh viễn không muốn rời khỏi Alamo nữa. Còn Theodore, cuối cùng cũng nhận ra chẳng rõ từ bao giờ, trái tim anh đã vĩnh viễn thuộc về cô một cách vô điều kiện...\n\"Cô ước gì mình có đủ nhiều kinh nghiệm để biết cách xử lý những cảm giác đang không ngừng dâng lên trong lòng.

Cô muốn nghe tên mình bật ra trên môi anh. Nhưng trên hết, cô muốn được anh chạm vào. Chỉ một lần thôi, để xem liệu nó có nóng bỏng như những gì cô tưởng tượng.\"\nĐây là một cuốn sách đáng đọc mà tác giả LaVyrle Spencer muốn dành tặng cho những người yêu mến cô.\n",

    "description": "Đây là câu chuyện về một bầy ốc sên sống tại Quê Hương Bồ Công Anh, dưới tán lá ô rô rậm rạp, vốn vẫn sống một cuộc đời chậm chạp, lặng lẽ, và chỉ gọi nhau đơn giản là “sên”, cho tới khi một con trong số chúng nghĩ rằng thật bất công khi không có một cái tên riêng và nhất là nó muốn biết được lý do tại sao loài sên lại chậm chạp đến thế. Bỏ ngoài tai mọi lời chế giễu của những đồng loại đã quá quen với cuộc sống chậm chạp và lặng lẽ vốn có, kẻ “nổi loạn” quyết chí rời xa gia trang ô rô, lên đường kiếm tìm cho mình một cái tên riêng cùng lời giải đáp cho thắc mắc bấy lâu. Trên hành trình ấy, nó gặp một bác rùa già, người đã đặt cho nó cái tên “Dũng Khí” và chỉ cho nó thấy tận mắt một hiểm họa lớn đối với mọi loài sinh vật của đồng cỏ: con người!\nChú ốc sên nhỏ quyết định quay về báo tin cho đồng loại, cùng với đó là cả nhà kiến, bọ hung, và chuột chũi… mà nó gặp trên đường. Chính nhờ sự chậm chạp và gan dạ, “Dũng Khí” đã giúp nhiều sinh vật thoát khỏi nguy hiểm, đồng thời dẫn dắt các anh em của mình vượt qua chặng đường gian khổ, tìm đến một Quê Hương Bồ Công Anh mới, an toàn và đầy hứa hẹn.\nChuyện con ốc sên muốn biết tại sao nó chậm chạp là một trong số các tác phẩm thú vị của Luis Sepúlveda dành cho độc giả mọi lứa tuổi, ra đời từ một câu hỏi bất ngờ của cậu cháu trai Daniel trong lúc quan sát một con ốc sên trong vườn nhà: “Ông ơi, tại sao ốc sên lại chậm chạp đến vậy?” Và câu chuyện về “Dũng Khí” - một chú ốc sên trẻ tuổi với một hành trình lưu vong, những cuộc gặp gỡ và sự dấn thân dù đau đớn nhưng vô cùng ý nghĩa đã được dựng lên. Với giọng kể trong sáng, nhẹ nhàng, Luis Sepúlveda mở ra trước mắt chúng ta một thế giới thiên nhiên gần gũi, sinh động, ẩn chứa một câu chuyện ngụ ngôn mang triết lý sâu xa về cuộc sống, về bản chất mỗi loài, lòng dũng cảm, khát vọng và nhu cầu khẳng định cái tôi. Sẽ không bất ngờ khi tác phẩm mới nhất của nhà văn Chilê này sẽ chinh phục được trái tim của mọi độc giả trẻ em và người lớn.\n",

Hikikomori là những người chỉ sống quanh quẩn trong phòng, không làm việc, không giao tiếp xã hội, cứ mãi mê man với cuộc sống ảo trên mạng, từ đó dẫn đến những mục ruỗng tâm hồn.\nSato là một thanh niên 22 tuổi nhưng hết bốn năm trong cuộc đời cậu đã sống như một kẻ khép kín, không giao tiếp, kỳ thị đời sống cộng đồng. Lối sống đó đáng ra sẽ tù đọng trôi đi mãi như thế trong căn phòng trọ bừa bộn nếu một ngày kia cậu không gặp một cô gái lạ lùng - xuất hiện trong trắng như thiên thần nhưng toàn thốt ra những lời kỳ quặc. Cô tự nhận có thể chữa chứng hikikomori cho cậu, miễn là cậu bằng lòng ký vào một hợp đồng do cô thảo.\nLiệu người con gái thiên thần này có thể thay đổi số mệnh của Sato? Một điểm thú vị nữa là ngoài vấn nạn hikikomori, câu chuyện còn lôi tuột ra trước mặt người đọc một loạt vấn đề nổi cộm trong xã hội hiện đại như anime otaku, mọt game online, tự tử qua mạng... Tất cả được khai thác một cách bi kịch nhưng cũng không kém phần hài hước, và điều đó khiến câu chuyện có được một điểm nhìn sâu sắc: bàng quan, giễu cợt mà cũng nhân ái vô cùng.\n",

    "description": "Mỗi năm, một tuyển tập Văn Mới lại ra mắt bạn đọc, gồm những tác phẩm văn xuôi ngắn có tìm tòi và có chất lượng. Sau mỗi chặng đường năm năm, những người làm sách lại tuyển chọn Văn Mới 5 năm như một cách nhìn nhận lại chặng đường ngắn vừa qua. Văn Mới 5 Năm (2011 - 2015) là hợp tuyển năm năm lần thứ ba trong tủ sách này.\nHợp tuyển năm năm lần này gồm 40 tác phẩm của những tác giả đã thành danh và được mến mộ, bên cạnh những tác giả mới xuất hiện trên văn đàn. Như thường lệ, tác phẩm xuất hiện đầu tiên trong tuyển tập là truyện gây chú ý nhất. Năm nay, vinh dự ấy thuộc về Đi thăm chồng của nhà văn Dạ Ngân. Đi thăm chồng là một góc nhìn khác về chiến tranh, có khốc liệt, có hi sinh, nhưng cũng rất đời thường, nhân bản. Truyện kể về những người vợ trẻ \"yêu chồng, nhớ chồng và thèm chồng\" trong chiến tranh tổ chức những chuyến đi thăm chồng, để có được những giây phút gần chồng. Những người phụ nữ ấy vượt qua bom đạn để gặp chồng với hai nỗi phấp phỏng là không biết có được hoài thai đứa con và không biết lần sau có còn gặp chồng hay không. Truyện được kể bằng một giọng như ào ạt, bỗ bã để giấu đi nỗi nghẹn ngào, xót xa, bởi \"thương chồng là phải ráng mà đi… lần nào cũng có thể là lần cuối, biết đâu!\".\nNgoài Dạ Ngân, Văn Mới 5 Năm (2011 - 2015) cũng giới thiệu nhiều tác giả đã ghi dấu trong lòng bạn đọc yêu mến văn chương nước nhà như: Ma Văn Kháng với Nỗi nhớ mưa phùn, Lê Minh Khuê với Ráp Việt, Hồ Anh Thái với Họ ở lại để chờ nhau … Hợp tuyển cũng giới thiệu cũng cây bút trẻ sung sức, tràn đầy nhiệt huyết văn chương như Văn Thành Lê, Uông Triều, Trương Anh Quốc, Nguyễn Trương Quý… Ngoài ra, những cây bút định hình được phong cách nghệ thuật như Nguyễn Ngọc Tư, Đỗ Tiến Thụy, Nguyễn Danh Lam… cũng có mặt trong “bản hòa tấu văn chương” này. “Hiện tượng mới” của làng văn nghệ trong nước là Nguyễn Trí cũng xuất hiện trong tuyển tập với truyện ngắn Đồ tể.\n",

    "description": "\"Phụ nữ trước ngưỡng 30 là một giỏ hoa nhiều sắc mà sắc nào cũng đượm một chút tiếc nuối\".\nLàm gì để tuổi ba mươi tới mà trái tim không hoảng hốt, không chênh vênh, để an nhiên đón ba mươi của mình và nhận ra quãng nào trong đời cũng luôn có những vẻ đẹp rất riêng của tuổi?\nHãy bình tâm ngồi xuống, nhấm tách trà tự pha với hương vị yêu thích nhất và đi qua ba mươi cùng Ý Yên khi lật giở từng trang sách Khi Phụ Nữ Uống Trà, Đàn Ông Nên Cẩn Thận, bạn sẽ nhận thấy mình chưa bao giờ đơn độc trên con đường bước thêm một bước tới trưởng thành và yêu thương.\nVới vỏn vẹn 176 trang sách, Phan Ý Yên đã mang đến cho những người phụ nữ của mình trái tim của một cô gái trẻ tha thiết yêu thương và hi vọng, khối óc của một người phụ nữ chín chắn, quyến rũ và can đảm buông bỏ. Đó là khi chúng ta cùng đi tìm màu sắc cho ba mươi của mình trong “Ba mươi của bạn có màu gì?”, để tự mang đến cho tuổi mình những bức tranh sống động, nhiều nét vẽ và dù mang màu sắc gì chăng nữa, chúng cũng vẫn thật xinh đẹp. Đó cũng là lúc chúng ta đi qua hết “365 ngày may mắn” và nhận ra rằng bản thân chúng ta luôn luôn có những cơ hội thứ 365, tuổi trẻ sẽ không kết thúc chừng nào chúng ta vẫn mỉm cười mỗi sáng, tin rằng mình luôn còn 365 cơ hội để bắt đầu, và “thanh xuân là ở trong tim mình”. Trong những trang sách của Ý Yên, bạn cũng sẽ tìm được cách để thực hiện động từ khó nhất, động từ “dám”, khi “ai cũng có một điều hối tiếc”: dám chấp nhận, can đảm từ bỏ, và nhận ra hạnh phúc từ những cú ngã…\nKhác với những nỗi buồn thâm trầm và da diết thường thấy trong các tác phẩm trước của Ý Yên, Khi Phụ Nữ Uống Trà, Đàn Ông Nên Cẩn Thận mang đến cho độc giả lòng tin yêu, niềm lạc quan và sự tỉnh táo khi nhìn nhận vấn đề.\nBằng giọng văn gần gũi như lời tâm tình trong những cuộc trà, Ý Yên dịu dàng sẻ chia với phụ nữ ba mươi những điều họ lo lắng nhất, trăn trở nhất, về tình yêu, về trưởng thành, về được - mất trong cuộc sống đa diện. Nhưng không vì thế mà cuốn sách chỉ là món quà dành riêng cho những ai chuẩn bị đón ba mươi của mình. Vì dù bạn đang hai mươi, hai lăm hay đã đi qua ngưỡng ba mươi, Khi Phụ Nữ Uống Trà, Đàn Ông Nên Cẩn Thận vẫn sẽ là món quà nhỏ xinh để bạn đủ dũng khí và an nhiên đón tuổi mới của mình.\nĐặc biệt tác phẩm này được thiết kế bìa một cách độc đáo khi bìa áo chỉ duy nhất là nền đỏ với những chấm màu xanh gợi sự tò mò để bạn đọc dần dần tự khám phá nhiều điều lý thú qua từng trang sách.\n\n",

    "description": "Tập truyện ngắn được ba cây bút nữ đại diện cho ba miền đất nước viết về những rung động trong tình yêu. Tình cảm được bắt đầu trên ghế nhà trường, với sự vụng dại ngây ngô, cho đến những con người tưởng chừng như khô khan, đã đi làm, đã trải qua nhiều sóng gió, va đập của cuộc đời - nhưng trong tình yêu vẫn luôn đắm say, khao khát, trọn vẹn hay có những khoảnh khắc không thể lý giải nổi mình.\nĐại diện cho ba miền của đất nước, vậy nên cách tiếp cận và kể lại những câu chuyện tình yêu của các tác giả cũng rất riêng và rất đặc trưng của ba miền. Song, dù tình yêu có được biểu đạt theo cách nào đi nữa, thì nó vẫn là một thứ rất khó lý giải và biết tường tận căn nguyên. Tại sao khi thất tình người ta lại chỉ thấy những màu đen tối vây quanh? Tại sao đã có đôi mà vẫn nhung nhớ và có tình cảm với người khác? Bao lâu thì thoát ra khỏi cuộc tình cũ? Cách nào để tìm thấy tình yêu đích thực? Hay rung động này liệu có phải là yêu?\n21 truyện ngắn với nhiều cung bậc cảm xúc và cách giải quyết vấn đề trong tình yêu sẽ khiến người đọc như thấy được hình bóng mình đâu đó trong mỗi câu chuyện nhỏ. Như tác giả Nhiên Phượng đã tâm sự: “Tôi viết những câu chuyện nhỏ thương tặng tuổi trẻ cô đơn nhưng không kém phần rực rỡ. Một tuổi trẻ bồng bột, nông nổi, khờ dại, day dứt. Một tuổi trẻ sống cuồng nhiệt, yêu chân thành, hoang hoải kiếm tìm hạnh phúc và dễ tổn thương trước sóng gió cuộc đời. Câu chữ trong truyện có thể còn vụng về nhưng rất giản dị, chân thành. Bởi tôi đã viết bằng cả trái tim của một người trẻ sống và yêu như thế.”\n“Cuộc sống còn điều gì quý giá hơn tình yêu? Không, hẳn nhiên là không.Ấy thế mà rất nhiều người đau khổ vì tình yêu, tại sao vậy?Họ đau khổ vì họ đặt ra cho tình yêu của mình quá nhiều điều kiện, họ quên mất giây phút đầu tiên khi tim họ rung lên, hối hả mách bảo trí óc rằng kia là một nửa của mình, giây phút đó tinh khôi và trong sáng đến nhường nào.

    "description": "“Văn bản giống như giếng thần không bao giờ cạn nước. Người độc các thế hệ đến soi mình vào gương giếng ấy không chỉ thấy màu xanh vĩnh cửu của bầu trời, mà còn cả khuôn mặt mình thay đổi theo thời gian. Nhưng văn bản không có sẵn, “gương kia treo ở trên tường”, mà cần ít nhất một bàn tay vén màn, phủi bụi của phê bình. Nhà phê bình, với tư cách là một “siêu người đọc”, bằng những cách đọc khác, sẽ làm mới những tác phẩm cũ, hoặc quen thuộc, mở thêm các không gian thẩm mỹ.Văn học trung đại Việt Nam, từ giữa thế kỷ XVIII, do ảnh hưởng của văn hóa đô thị, dù là phương Đông, trung đại, cũng đã tạo ra được một thời đại văn chương với những quan niệm, thể loại, tác giả mới. Khảo sát các nhà thơ từ Nguyễn Gia Thiều, Phạm Thái, Nguyễn Du, Hồ Xuân Hương, Bà Huyện Thanh Quan, Dương Khuê đến Tú Xương, Tản Đà cho thấy một xu hướng vận động của văn chương Việt, từ tính chất nông thôn, quan lại đến tính chất bình dân, đô thị. Chính điều này làm cho văn học Việt Nam trung đại có khả năng chuyển đổi hệ hình bước vào thời hiện đại, mở ra một thời đại khác.Trong bộ ba “Mắt thơ” của tôi, nếu Phê bình phong cách Thơ Mới là mái trước của ngôi nhà rộng - thơ, thì Hé gương cho người đọc là mái sau. Cả hai, với độ nghiêng vát lớn, tôn cao cho đỉnh nóc, Thơ như là mỹ học của cái khác. Tuy vậy, Hé gương cho người đọc vẫn có giá trị tự thân, độc lập của nó. Đây chính là lý do tôi muốn gửi đến bạn đọc.”\n(Đỗ Lai Thúy)\n",

Đồng thời, Rhyme phải xử lý cả một cuộc điều tra đang diễn ra song song, liên quan tới đối thủ từng xuất hiện trong series trinh thám này: Richard Logan, biệt hiệu Thợ Đồng Hồ. Chiến dịch phối hợp được thực hiện giữa văn phòng của Rhyme và Cảnh sát Liên bang Mexico, sau khi người ta xác định rằng Logan đang có mặt tại đó.Hai cuộc điều tra song song khiến tình trạng sức khỏe vốn bấp bênh của Rhyme càng lúc càng gặp nguy hiểm. Thậm chí chính Rhyme, với đầu óc mẫn tiệp, cũng không thể phán đoán trước những bước ngoặt nghẹt thở của vụ án.

Đó là một Tiểu Mễ yêu đắm say và nồng nàn trong \"Sẽ có thiên thần thay anh yêu em”, là Doãn Hạ Mạt cứng cỏi, kiên cường trong “Bong bóng mùa hè”, là Bách Thảo mang trái tim trong trẻo, ý chí vươn lên không ngừng trong “Thiếu nữ toàn phong”.Thế nhưng khi đến với “Tường vi đêm đầu tiên” độc giả sẽ hoàn toàn bất ngờ và bị chinh phục bởi sự đột phá trong cách sáng tạo hình tượng nhân vật và ngòi bút trữ tình vừa đằm thắm vừa sắc nhọn. Vẫn là những câu từ như ướp hương hoa nhưng Diệp Anh - nhân vật nữ chính của tác phẩm được hiện lên đa chiều và nhiều góc cạnh hơn.Diệp Anh, cô gái được sinh ra từ đêm đen u uất, như đóa tường vi bừng nở sau một đêm sấm sét ngợp trời, cô gọi mình là Dạ Anh, cô gái tới để hủy diệt, vùi lấp đi tất cả.\nMột trái tim và tâm hồn u tối trong diện mạo xinh đẹp, lạ thường. Diệp Anh đã dùng sắc đẹp và tài năng của mình thầm lặng thực hiện âm mưu lợi dụng anh em và gia đình họ Tạ, một danh gia vọng tộc trong ngành thời trang làm bàn đạp trong kế hoạch trả thù. Cô sẵn sàng bóp méo nhân cách của bản thân để đạt được mục đích. Minh Hiểu Khê đã đặt Diệp Anh vào giữa ranh giới mong manh của Tình yêu và Thù hận.\nCon người ta, có nên chăng để những hờn ghen và thù hận phôi phai theo năm tháng, quên những đớn đau của ngày hôm qua để sống cho hiện tại? Đọc Tường vi đêm đầu tiên, độc giả sẽ được trải nghiệm quá trình đấu tranh, kiếm tìm những giá trị đích thực của cuộc sống. Ở đó hằn sâu bao đau đớn và nước mắt của Diệp Anh. Tường vi đêm đầu tiên đã chuyển tải được những giằng xé nội tâm, diễn biến tâm lí phức tạp trong lớp ngôn từ nhẹ nhàng, uyển chuyển và tinh tế. Táo bạo khai phá đề tài Báo thù nhưng Minh Hiểu Khê đã khẳng định được tài năng của mình trên từng trang viết.\n",

Chẳng thành phố nào được xây dựng để bị người ta phá hủy, nó hình thành để ngày một mạnh hơn, phát triển hơn, tươi đẹp hơn. Thành phố vẫn có những con người ngày đêm vất vả, mặt mũi lấm lem không thấy ánh mặt trời, tay xách nặng, miệng ngân nga. Họ vẫn hát trên những nhọc nhằn mồ hôi và nước mắt.Tôi có những lúc mệt mỏi, gục ngã và tổn thương, thất vọng và nhọc nhằn nhưng vẫn ôm trong tim những khát khao tươi trẻ nhất, dùng lực hút của hoài bão mà đứng lên tiến về phía trước.\n(...) Tôi chiêm nghiệm viết là một nghề cô đơn, mỗi khi cầm bút lên chỉ có một mình. Nhưng tôi không thể cầm bút cả đời. Đặt bút xuống, bước ra khỏi căn phòng yên tĩnh, tôi lại là một phần của cộng đồng rộng lớn.\nTrong những năm rất trẻ, tôi đã hay tự hỏi mình sinh ra trong cuộc đời này làm gì. Mình tồn tại có ý nghĩa gì? Giờ thì tôi chỉ trẻ, không còn rất trẻ nữa, đã ngừng đặt câu hỏi ấy. Tôi tin mỗi người chúng ta tồn tại để duy trì sự tồn tại của người khác. Họ cũng đang làm điều đó cho ta.\nTôi tin như thế, vì tôi muốn mọi thứ sẽ như thế.\"\n(Phạm Anh Thư)\n",

Năm 1921 ông được trao giải Nobel Văn học vì \"những tác phẩm xuất sắc mang phong cách tinh tế, chủ nghĩa nhân văn sâu sắc và khí chất Gô-loa đích thực\"… Đến năm 1922, sách của ông đã nằm trong danh sách cấm của Giáo Hội Công Giáo La Mã, bởi trước tác của ông chống lại sự mê hoặc tôn giáo, giáo điều chủ nghĩa; dưới ngòi bút châm biếm đả kích, trào lộng, A. France mỉa mai những luận điệu thần thánh, những thiết chế Nhà nước, những thối nát của nhà thờ cùng với sự đớn hèn của loài người.\nCác hung thần lên cơn khát là một thiên hùng ca bi tráng về thời kỳ Công xã Paris. Nhân vật chính của câu chuyện là Évariste Gamelin, một họa sĩ trẻ tràn trề sức sống và lý tưởng, một người con hiếu thảo sống cùng mẹ già nghèo khó, một người bạn vô hại dễ thương, một công dân nhiệt tình yêu nước, một chiến sĩ tuyệt đối trung thành với Cách mạng được bổ nhiệm làm hội thẩm của Tòa án Cách mạng Pháp. Tư tưởng cực đoan và sự sùng bái cá nhân của Gamelin đối với các nhà lãnh đạo công xã Robespierre, Marat,... và cơn ghen cuồng điên trong mối tình si chớm nở đã từng bước đưa anh từ một nghệ sĩ mộng mơ thành một tên giết người hàng loạt. Vì chế độ Cộng hòa, anh hy sinh không hối tiếc bao nhiêu sinh mạng, kể cả bạn bè, và nếu cần, cả em gái mình để làm lễ dâng lên bàn thờ Tổ quốc.\nĐiều gì sẽ đến khi lý tưởng trở thành ngọn hải đăng tỏa sáng dẫn đường, khi lý tưởng trở thành vị thần được tôn thờ mù quáng, khi lý tưởng được sùng bái một cách bất khả tư nghị? Và chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra khi con người trở thành nô lệ của dư luận, khi suy nghĩ bị dẫn dắt bởi đám đông. Đó là khi máy chém sẽ trở thành vị chủ tế, mạng sống và máu của con người được xem như vật hiến sinh, những buổi hành hình trở thành lễ hội náo nhiệt.\nKhi sự phi lý trở nên bình thường, khi quyền lực trao tay những kẻ vô tri, con người trở thành điên rồ và khát máu.\nCác hung thần lên cơn khát, một kiệt tác của A.France không chỉ là một tiểu thuyết lịch sử cách mạng. Dưới ngòi bút của một thiên tài, một xã hội thị dân Paris với đầy đủ các cung bậc cuộc sống, tình yêu, dục vọng, với ghen tuông được tái hiện. Các hung thần lên cơn khát còn là một bản trường ca về sự giao hòa giữa lý tưởng và tình người, về cách mạng và nhân văn, giữa duy tâm với duy vật, cả thánh thiện và tàn ác, về chiến thắng và chiến bại, về sự sống cùng cái chết, tất cả đã được Anatole France dệt thành một câu chuyện đa sắc sinh động.\n",

Để có tiền đóng học phí và trang trải chi phí sinh hoạt, cô phải vừa học vừa làm thêm tại một quán café Starbuck ở khu ngoại thành Bắc Kinh. Tại đây, cô gặp gỡ và yêu chàng kiến trúc sư Hoa kiều tài năng nhưng bị tàn tật là Vương Lịch Xuyên. Tuy nhiên, khi tình yêu đang độ rực rỡ, thì đột nhiên Lịch Xuyên vô cớ chia tay và về nước (Thụy Sĩ), để lại Tiểu Thu chìm đắm trong đau buồn và nghi hoặc. 6 năm sau, Tiểu Thu tốt nghiệp đại học và vào làm việc tại tập đoàn kiến trúc CPJ của Thụy Sĩ. Tại đây, cô đã gặp lại Lịch Xuyên và dần dần phát hiện ra, anh rời xa Vì anh mang căn bệnh ung thư ác tính và không muốn cô phải sống một cuộc sống thấp thỏm lo âu vì người mình yêu có thể sẽ chết bất cứ lúc nào. Tuy nhiên, cũng chính lúc này, bệnh tình của Lịch Xuyên trở nên nguy ngập, anh kiên quyết phải rời xa Tiểu Thu, để cô quên anh và tìm được hạnh phúc khác.\nTiểu Thu hứa với anh là cô sẽ “move on” với một điều kiện là anh phải tiếp tục chiến đấu với căn bệnh ung thư và phải sống. 3 năm sau, sau khi ghép tủy, bệnh của Lịch Xuyên chuyển biến tốt hơn.\nLo lắng cho Tiểu Thu, anh trở về thăm cô và từ đó, hai người không bao giờ xa nhau nữa.\nNhững chương đầu tiên của tác phẩm Gặp Gỡ Vương Lịch Xuyên được Thi Định Nhu (bút danh Huyền Ẩn, người Trung Quốc, hiện đang sinh sống tại Canada) đăng trên website văn học mạng lớn nhất Trung Quốc (mạng Tấn Giang) từ tháng 11/2008. Tác phẩm lập tức thu hút sự quan tâm của số lượng lớn người đọc online (hơn 1,3 triệu lượt người trong vòng 6 tháng). Không bao lâu sau đó, Công ty Sách Hoàng Sơn đã mua bản quyền và xuất bản sách giấy vào tháng 04/2009. Ngay sau khi có mặt tại các nhà sách, tác phẩm đã lập tức gây nên cơn sốt. Một năm sau, công ty sách Vớ Xanh cũng mua bản quyền và xuất bản bản tiếng Hoa phồn thể tại Đài Loan, và cũng được độc giả Đài Loan đón nhận nồng nhiệt.\nHiện nay, Gặp Gỡ Vương Lịch Xuyên đang được chuyển thể thành phim. Ngoài ra, dự án audio book Gặp Gỡ Vương Lịch Xuyên cũng đang được tiến hành.\n",

    "description": "Bộ tiểu thuyết trinh thám Mười tội ác của tác giả Tri Thù điều tra về 10 vụ án kinh thiên động địa được dựa trên nguyên mẫu 10 vụ án có thật từng gây chấn động toàn Trung Quốc vừa được phát hành tại Việt Nam.\nNhân vật trong các vụ án đó là những tội phạm giết người, những kẻ biến thái chuyên hủy hoại dung nhan người khác, những hung thủ băm xác người, những con yêu râu xanh. Đọc truyện Mười tội ác của Tri Thù, bạn sẽ phát hiện con người có thể ác đến mức không cần màng đến đạo đức. Vì tiền có thể giết người, một ông chú ngoại tứ tuần, có thể làm chuyện đồi bại với những cô bé vị thành niên, giết người rồi hãm hiếp tử thi, giết người băm xác, ăn thịt người, lột da người, những kẻ hoang dâm vô độ... đủ mọi hình thái tội phạm được dần dần phơi bày trên mỗi trang sách. Đáng chú ý, Tri Thù viết về tội ác rất nhạy bén và tinh tế. Ông mô tả chi tiết nhưng không hề lên gân cốt để cố tình \"uy hiếp\" tinh thần độc giả. Dưới ngòi bút của Tri Thù, những thủ đoạn bệnh hoạn, lệch lạc, tàn nhẫn… dần dần hiện ra một cách tự nhiên, lôi cuốn người đọc.\nĐiểm hấp dẫn nhất của bộ truyện này chính là những tình tiết khiếp đảm, rùng rợn mà độc giả không thể hình dung ra nổi. Nó giống như một bộ phim kinh dị vậy, tuy người ta thấy sợ những câu chuyện máu me, tàn nhẫn, tim đập liên hồi, da đầu tê bì nhưng vẫn không thoát khỏi sự tò mò để theo dõi tiếp những diễn biến kinh hoàng sau đó.\nCuốn tiểu thuyết giúp con người nhận thức được tính nhân văn sau mỗi vụ án để hướng thiện, như tác giả từng viết “Trên thế giới không có kẻ xấu, chỉ có những người tốt trót phạm sai lầm”. Cũng chính vì thế, tuy viết truyện điều tra phá án, nhưng Tri Thù không nhấn mạnh vào quá trình đi tìm tội ác, cũng như các kỹ xảo phá án hay sự thông minh tột bậc của các cảnh sát mà đặc biệt nhấn mạnh vào nguyên nhân phạm tội.\n",

    "description": "Một trong những cặp đôi trẻ mỗi lần kết hợp lại mang về những tác phẩm giàu cảm xúc, Hamlet Trương - Iris Cao, đã trở lại cùng Mỉm cười cho qua. Một chút nữ tính và yếu đuối trong tình yêu của Iris Cao hòa với sự trải nghiệm cuộc sống qua triết lý nhẹ nhàng nhưng sâu sắc của Hamlet Trương đã giúp những tác phẩm của họ trở thành \"sách gối đầu giường\" của thế hệ bạn đọc trẻ những năm gần đây. Tác phẩm của họ liên tục gây \"sốt\" trên thị trường với số lượng tiêu thụ đáng kinh ngạc lên đến hàng trăm ngàn bản sách, khởi đầu cho thời đại mới của những cây bút trẻ được yêu thích nhiệt thành.\nChặng đường để có được Mỉm cười cho qua thu hút ngay từ tựa sách, cả hai tác giả trẻ đã liên tục đi và học hỏi. Yêu đầy tràn, đớn đau cuồng nhiệt, say mê trong từng khoảnh khắc thanh xuân. Dù chỉ mới đôi mươi nhưng cách sống, cách yêu của họ như thể luôn sợ tuổi trẻ sẽ trôi đi mất, họ trân trọng từng phút giây, tận hưởng tất cả buồn vui của cuộc sống đem lại. Tác phẩm của Hamlet Trương - Iris Cao mang đến cho người đọc một niềm hân hoan yêu cuộc sống, tha thiết với đời mình và nhận ra những giá trị cảm xúc trong hiện tại mà đôi lần vì điều gì đó mà lãng quên.\n\"Trong chớp mắt, những ngày tuổi xanh vùng vằng quay lưng rời bước. Tôi nói thế nào nó cũng không quay đầu lại. Chẳng ai có hai lần thanh xuân. Thế nên hãy sống, hãy yêu thật cam đảm, nhé!\" (Iris Cao)\nThông điệp của Mỉm cười cho qua nằm ở sự phớt lờ những chuyện vốn dĩ không thể thay đổi. Khi còn trẻ, chúng ta thường hay gặp những trở ngại về tình yêu, công việc, gia đình… và như một thói quen, chúng ta là khiến mình đắm chìm mãi trong đó. Cuốn sách với thông điệp tích cực rằng chúng ta sẽ luôn là những người tiến về phía trước, đối với những khó khăn hay chất chồng đớn đau, chúng ta chỉ cần \"MỈM CƯỜI\" và \"CHO QUA\". Rồi chúng ta sẽ thảnh thơi bước tiếp vì cuộc đời còn dài và tất cả đau đớn đó chỉ là một phần của trải nghiệm.\n\"Nếu có một ngày thực sự gặp lại, chúng ta chắc chắn sẽ vui, vì quá khứ chưa bao giờ buồn. Người mãi mãi là người dưng mà tôi thương nhất Sài Gòn.\" (Hamlet Trương)\nNhận định\n\"Có thể gọi Hamlet Trương và Iris Cao là “Đại sứ Hạnh Phúc”. Hai bạn trẻ này luôn thể hiện thông điệp sống lạc quan qua những mẩu chuyện gần gũi, giản đơn về gia đình, tình yêu, tình bạn và những cung bậc cảm xúc từ chính cuộc sống xung quanh… Họ đang truyền sức trẻ và năng lượng sống tích cực đến cho tôi!\"\n(Thu Hà - Thư ký tòa soạn phía Nam báo Hoa Học Trò)\n\"Không phải ngẫu nhiên mà Hamlet Trương và Iris Cao sở hữu lượng phát hành sách “khổng lồ”, họ là những cây bút mang nặng hơi thở của thời đại. Họ mang đến cho độc giả của mình những cảm xúc chân thật, nồng ấm mà đôi khi những hoa mỹ khoa trương không tài nào làm được. Họ đứng trên vị trí của người trẻ để nghĩ suy và xây dựng, nên họ xứng đáng được người trẻ tin tưởng đồng hành trong những ngày trưởng thành của mình.\"\n(Hoàng Trang- Biên Tập Viên Nhà Xuất Bản Văn Học)\n\"Cảm ơn Cuộc Đời đã cho tôi có cơ hội hợp tác với Hamlet Trương và Iris Cao, tôi gọi đó là Mối Lương Duyên An Lành! Họ nhiệt thành, họ đầy thấu cảm và nhất là luôn tỏa \"cái khí chất\" mạnh mẽ nhưng rất ung dung tận hưởng từng giây từng phút của cuộc sống này. Chúng tôi trân thương gửi đến các quý độc giả một món quà từ cảm xúc của Hamlet Trương và Iris Cao: sách \"Mỉm cười cho qua\".\n(Thảo Minh Châu - Giám đốc Minh Châu Books)\n\n",

    "description": "“Người ta tự hỏi liệu còn người kể chuyện nào khác có thể khéo léo đến thế trong việc phủ kín các trang viết của mình với những âm mưu đối đầu với âm mưu, với hiểm nguy xen cài lãng mạn, trên một tấm phông nền đầy những màu sắc sống động, với lụa là và nhung phục, đao kiếm và trang sức.”\nScaramouche - Kiếm sĩ không trái tim là câu chuyện về André-Louis Moreau. André-Louis Moreau chào đời mang theo khiếu hài hước cùng cảm giác thế giới thật điên rồ. Nhưng khi chứng kiến người bạn thân thiết bị Hầu tước de La Tour d’ Azyr sát hại, André-Louis cảm thấy mình buộc phải dấn thân vào sự điên rồ của thế giới để xác lập lại công lý và tạo cơ hội cho những tư tưởng của bạn mình tìm thấy tiếng nói của chúng trên đầu lưỡi anh.\nTừ một luật sư, anh trở thành một nhà diễn thuyết, một anh hề, một kiếm sĩ, rồi một chính trị gia. Ở mỗi ngã rẽ của đời mình, anh đều chạm mặt với Hầu tước một cách đầy bi kịch. Nhưng đợi anh ở cuối con đường gian truân ấy lại chẳng phải là công lý như anh hằng mong đợi mà là một sự thật tréo ngoe và buốt giá.\nĐược viết bằng thứ văn chương phong phú, giàu hình ảnh, đầy những đối thoại sắc sảo, những quan sát tinh tế, cuốn tiểu thuyết ra đời từ năm 1921 này vẫn chưa bao giờ đánh mất đi sức hấp dẫn của nó. Ở nhiều nơi, nó đã được xếp vào hàng kinh điển. Một dấu son trong sự nghiệp chói sáng của Rafael Sabatini.\nRafael Sabatini (1875 - 1950) được coi là chàng hiệp sĩ cuối cùng của thể loại tiểu thuyết “áo choàng và thanh kiếm”. Ông mang trong mình hai dòng máu Anh và Italia. Thành danh với những câu chuyện phiêu lưu đầy kịch tính và lãng mạn, ông là một trong những nhà văn nổi tiếng và được hâm mộ nhất khi còn sinh thời.\nNhững cuộc phiêu lưu dưới ngòi bút của ông không chỉ làm say mê bạn đọc mà còn tạo cảm hứng cho sự ra đời của hàng loạt phim điện ảnh. Ảnh hưởng của ông thậm chí còn kéo dài đến sau này. Ba cuốn tiểu thuyết nổi tiếng của ông The Sea Hawk, The Black Swan và Scaramouche - Kiếm sĩ không trái tim đã được chuyển thể thành những bộ phim khá nổi danh của Hollywood những năm 1940.\n",

    "description": "Hania được sáng tác năm 1876, là một trong những tác phẩm tạo dựng vị thế số một của Henryk Sienkiewicz trên văn đàn Ba Lan. Tác phẩm không phải một tiểu thuyết lịch sử, mà kể câu chuyện tình trong một gia đình quý tộc Ba Lan thế kỷ 19.\nHenryk Sienkiewicz (1846 – 1916) là nhà văn Ba Lan giành Nobel Văn học năm 1905. Tại Việt Nam, độc giả biết tới ông qua các tác phẩm như Quo Vadis, Trên sa mạc và trong rừng thẳm. Cuốn Hania từng được Nhà xuất bản Kim Đồng phát hành với tên Hania – Tình yêu của tôi, nỗi buồn của tôivới bản dịch của Nguyễn Văn Thái. Nhà xuất bản Văn học và công ty sách Tao Đàn mới ra mắt cuốn sách với đúng tên gốc của nó – Hania – qua phần chuyển ngữ của dịch giả Nguyễn Hữu Dũng.\nNhân vật chính là Hania – cô gái xinh đẹp, trong sáng. Cô bé là cháu của Mikolai – lão bộc trong gia đình quý tộc Henryk. Trước khi qua đời, Mikolai nhờ cậu chủ Henryk quan tâm, chăm sóc cháu gái. Khi trở thành người đỡ đầu cho Hania lúc cô 16 tuổi, Henryk đã thay đổi cuộc đời thiếu nữ mồ côi. Anh buộc các gia nhân trong nhà phải cư xử với cô như với một tiểu thư, nhờ gia sư người Pháp dạy cô học… Hơn hết, anh giành tình yêu thầm lặng cho Hania. Bản tính ngại ngùng, lại quá nâng niu tình yêu với cô gái mà anh đỡ đầu, Henryk chẳng bao giờ thổ lộ được nỗi lòng. Anh đành lỗi nhịp trái tim với Hania. Trong khi, Selim – người bạn thân của Henryk – cũng dành tình cảm nồng nhiệt với cô gái thánh thiện.\nMối tình tay ba giữa Henryk – Hania – Selim đẩy cả ba con người vào bế tắc. Hai chàng trai không chỉ làm mất tình bạn đẹp mà trở nên thù hằn, tình cảm cả hai dành cho Hania cũng vô tình làm tổn thương cô gái trong những ngày đầu biết yêu. Sau cuộc bỏ trốn với Selim, Hania phải trả giá đắt. Dù vẫn được cả hai chàng trai yêu thương, lòng tự trọng không cho phép nàng đến với Henryk hay Selim, mà trở thành nữ tu.\nCâu chuyện khép lại với vẻ thanh thản của Hania trong tu viện, nhưng những nuối tiếc về tình yêu, rung cảm đầu đời vẫn đeo đẳng trong tâm hồn Henryk, trong cả tâm trí độc giả. Tác phẩm được kể trên bối cảnh cách nay hơn một trăm năm, nhưng có sức sống lâu bền bởi đã mang tới một tình yêu mang vẻ đẹp lý tưởng. Hania là minh chứng cho khát vọng tình yêu vượt qua mọi biên giới, ranh giới giàu nghèo, giai cấp, vượt qua những vị kỷ để hướng tới sự chân thành, cao cả. Tác phẩm thể hiện một Henryk Sienkiewicz tài năng trong miêu tả rung động tâm lý nhân vật.\n \n \n",

    "description": "Anatole France là một trong những nhà văn lớn nhất của nước Pháp thời cận đại, ông sinh ở Paris ngày 16 tháng 4 năm 1844, ngày 13 tháng 10 năm 1924 ở Tours, Indre-et-Loire, Pháp. Năm 1921 ông được trao giải Nobel Văn học vì \"những tác phẩm xuất sắc mang phong cách tinh tế, chủ nghĩa nhân văn sâu sắc và khí chất Gô-loa đích thực\"… Đến năm 1922, sách của ông đã nằm trong danh sách cấm của Giáo Hội Công Giáo La Mã, bởi trước tác của ông chống lại sự mê hoặc tôn giáo, giáo điều chủ nghĩa; dưới ngòi bút châm biếm đả kích, trào lộng, A. France mỉa mai những luận điệu thần thánh, những thiết chế Nhà nước, những thối nát của nhà thờ cùng với sự đớn hèn của loài người.\nThiên thần nổi loạn là một trong những tác phẩm xuất sắc nhất của A. France, thời kỳ sau này. Arcade một thiên thần hộ mệnh giáng phàm, trên con đường  tìm kiếm tri thức khoa học và chân lý đã đảo tung một trong những thư viện tư lớn nhất Châu Âu. Anh cùng các đồng bạn thiên thần xây dựng một đạo quân “ô hợp bát nháo” cùng hướng đến một mục tiêu chống lại thiên giới và hệ thống tín điều Ki tô thủ cựu; chống lại sự giam hãm, áp đặt tư tưởng của Thiên Chúa; phá vỡ xiềng xích niềm tin để nhận thức được thăng hoa.\nThiên thần nổi loạn như muốn đưa một thông điệp với loài người bé nhỏ: đức tin là cần thiết, nhưng đấy phải là một đức tin được thanh lọc bằng những hoài nghi khoa học, bằng tinh thần thánh thiện, bằng chủ nghĩa nhân văn, bằng một thời đại với sự cải cách phục hưng mới.\nVới kiến thức uyên bác về lịch sử Pháp, lịch sử tôn giáo, đặc biệt am hiểu về văn chương, hội họa xuyên suốt từ cổ đại, trung cổ, phục hưng tới cận đại, với văn phong trác tuyệt, A.France đã khéo léo lồng ghép cái triết lý hoài nghi của mình vào tiểu thuyết, đưa học thức uyên bác kết hợp với nghệ thuật đả kích châm biếm; đưa trí tưởng tượng kết hợp với hiện thực xã hội; đưa biên niên sử tôn giáo kết hợp với phóng tác văn chương; đưa Dionysus gặp gỡ các thánh Tông Đồ; đưa những linh vật giao du cùng ngoại đạo. Tất cả những điều ấy đã đưa ông thành một nghệ sĩ bậc thầy về kể chuyện, đem đến cho người đọc những áng văn tuyệt vời, bất hủ.\n",

    "description": "Tiếp theo quyển một và quyển hai, tác giả Chu Giang cho ra mắt tập sách Luận chiến văn chương quyển ba, vẫn thấm nhuần tinh thần đối thoại trong phê bình văn học. Với giọng văn cuốn hút, tác giả đưa ra một số vấn đề về lý luận, phê bình văn học - nghệ thuật nhằm tạo không gian trao đổi và tranh luận cởi mở, thông thoáng.\nNhận định\n\"Với vốn sống dạn dày từng trải; những am hiểu thấu đáo về văn chương, giới văn chương; cái tâm và trách nhiệm của người cầm bút và một thủ pháp nghệ thuật giản dị, thẳng thừng, nói thẳng, nói thật, nói “có sách, mách có chứng”, gọi đích danh sự việc, vấn đề cần tranh luận… Nguyễn Văn Lưu đã có những trang viết sắc sảo, thuyết phục lòng người mà không cần dài dòng thuyết giảng. Điển hình là những bài: Về hồi ký của Nguyễn Đăng Mạnh; Trạng Quỳnh - Xuân Sách và Chân dung nhà văn.\nNguyễn Văn Lưu, do nhiệt hứng luận chiến, đã tạo nên được cái mà ta có thể gọi là “giọng Nguyễn Văn Lưu”, phong cách tranh luận Nguyễn Văn Lưu. Trong văn chương, cái giọng và cái điệu là vô cùng quan trọng. Nó hấp dẫn, lôi cuốn người đọc, làm cho người đọc thích thú, khác xa những trang văn nhạt nhẽo, bình lặng, có cũng được mà không có cũng chẳng sao. Có thể có người không thích cái “giọng” ấy, cái tính cách phê bình ấy, nhưng biết làm sao… hay dở tính trời!.\"\n(Nguyễn Văn Thức)\n",

Tiểu thuyết này được xem là một trong bốn tác phẩm cổ điển hay nhất của văn học Trung Quốc.\nMột trong những thành công lớn nhất của Tam Quốc Diễn Nghĩa là tính chất quy mô, hoành tráng của cốt truyện và nhân vật. Bộ tiểu thuyết này có thể chia thành rất nhiều \"truyện nhỏ\" mà đa phần trong số đó có thể hoàn toàn dựng được thành những bộ phim truyện theo đúng nghĩa.\nTruyện Tam Quốc Diễn Nghĩa lấy bối cảnh vào thời suy vi của nhà Hán khi mà những hoàng đế cuối cùng của nhà Hán quá tin dùng giới hoạn quan mà gạt bỏ những bề tôi trung trực. Triều đình ngày càng bê tha, hư nát, khiến kinh tế suy sụp và an ninh bất ổn. Đến đời Hán Linh Đế, năm 184, loạn giặc Khăn Vàng nổ ra do Trương Giác, một người đã học được nhiều ma thuật và bùa phép chữa bệnh, cầm đầu. Sau đó là sự xuất hiện của ba anh em Lưu Bị, Quan Vũ và Trương Phi, cả ba người đều muốn dẹp loạn yên dân nên đã kết nghĩa với nhau ở vườn đào.\n",

Ta và người ấy từ hai người xa lạ đến với cuộc sống của nhau, thương nhau, rồi bỗng chốc từ những người thương lại trở về xa lạ.\nCùng nhau bước chung trên một con đường tuổi trẻ, nhưng có những đoạn ngồi cạnh nhau kể cho nhau nghe chuyện yêu thương, có những đoạn lại hờ hững bước qua nhau như người lạ, không hơn không kém.\nĐọc Người dưng trót nhớ, ta bỗng nhiên giật mình khi nhận ra rằng bản thân cũng đã từng ngốc nghếch dại khờ khi có một thời đã yêu thương như thế.

Những câu chuyện gắn liền với một thời kỳ tranh đấu hào hùng của dân tộc, những câu chuyện của hi sinh, mất mát, của chiến tranh ác liệt… của những năm tháng không thể nào quên.\nDường như với bất kỳ tác phẩm nào của mình đã xuất bản, nhà văn cũng luôn cẩn trọng đọc lại và chỉnh sửa những chi tiết chưa hài lòng. Như chính lời con trai của Cụ, nhà báo Nguyễn Phương Vũ, chia sẻ: “Đã từ lâu từ khi cầm bút bố tôi là người cẩn thận và luôn có trách nhiệm với câu chữ nên mỗi bản in dù là in lại nhưng ông luôn đọc, cắt gọt, chỉnh sửa, “uốn nắn”, tỉ mẩn như người dệt vải. Khi ông trao lại cho tôi để xử lý nhập liệu với một bản thảo chi chít màu mực, chữ, từ, câu mà ông thêm bớt đan xen ngang dọc. Cha tôi là vậy, sự cẩn trọng, kỹ lưỡng trong nghề viết như mối nợ tình với ông.”\n",

    "description": "Người mới làm lãnh đạo học từ lỗi lầm của bản thân. Nhà lãnh đạo thông minh học từ lỗi lầm của người khác.\nLãnh đạo, chủ đề được quan tâm đặc biệt trong bối cảnh nhiều thay đổi và biến động hiện nay, là nghệ thuật kích thích con tim và khối óc của những người bình thường, vì những kết quả phi thường. Con đường trở thành lãnh đạo không bằng phẳng, song nghệ thuật lãnh đạo là hoàn toàn có thể lĩnh hội được.\nTinh hoa lãnh đạo được John C. Maxwell viết trên quan điểm đó. Nếu mỗi chương của cuốn sách tương đương với một khóa đào tạo một thầy một trò với guru về lãnh đạo hàng đầu thế giới, thì 26 nguyên tắc đưa ra là phần tinh túy chắt lọc từ những thành công và thất bại trong hơn ba mươi năm lãnh đạo của ông.\nNgười bắt đầu làm lãnh đạo sẽ tìm thấy cảm hứng từ những lời khuyên J. Maxwell đưa ra trên mỗi nguyên tắc. Nhà lãnh đạo đã có kinh nghiệm sẽ phân tích và tận dụng triết lý về thuật lãnh đạo của ông trong sự cọ sát với thực tế của bản thân. Còn các nhà lãnh đạo chủ chốt sẽ ngay lập tức muốn áp dụng hệ thống nguyên tắc và triết lý ấy để gây dựng và phát triển đội ngũ lãnh đạo tương lai cho tổ chức của mình.\n",

    "description": "Hãy Cứ Khát Khao - Hãy Mãi Dại Khờ tập hợp câu chuyện về 20 sinh viên tốt nghiệp Học viện Quản lý Ấn Độ, phân viện Ahmedabad. Họ là doanh nhân sống vào những giai đoạn khác nhau, kinh doanh trong những ngành, những lĩnh vực khác nhau, có quan điểm khác nhau về cuộc sống, về kinh doanh,… Nhưng họ cùng có chung một điểm: Niềm tin vào sức mạnh của những ước mơ. Họ là những người đã lựa chọn bước đi trên con đường của riêng mình. Và Hãy Cứ Khát Khao - Hãy Mãi Dại Khờ cũng chính là phương châm sống mà 20 doanh nhân trẻ và thành đạt được nhắc đến trong cuốn sách này theo đuổi.\nBạn đọc sẽ bắt gặp trong cuốn sách này rất nhiều tấm gương thành đạt, như: Ruby Ashraf - giám đốc điều hành của Precious Formals, một công ty có giá 10 triệu đô trong ngành kinh doanh thời trang; Sanjeev Bikhchandani - nhà kinh doanh trong lĩnh vực thương mại trực tuyến thành công nhất tại Ấn Độ; Vinayak Chatterjee - Giám đốc Công ty Feedback Ventures - công ty tư vấn cơ sở hạ tầng và kỹ thuật hàng đầu Ấn Độ; Madan Mohanka - Giám đốc công tyTega Industries là công ty lớn thứ ba thế giới về thiết kế giải pháp trong lĩnh vực thiết bị khai thác khoáng sản…\nTác giả Rashmi Bansal chia sẻ: \"Tôi viết cuốn sách này để dành tặng cho những ai đang trằn trọc về những \"Giá như…\", hay \"Một ngày nào đó…\". Tôi mong giúp họ nắm bắt được cơ hội, để họ không phải thức dậy mỗi ngày với những nuối tiếc. Đương nhiên, họ cần có khả năng nhìn thấy tiềm năng thị trường, cơ hội cũng như những nhu cầu chưa được đáp ứng. Nhưng quan trọng hơn hết, họ có thể đứng trước tấm gương và nhìn thấy giá trị đích thực của bản thân\".\nVới mong muốn đó, trong bài viết của mình, tác giả Rashmi Bansal đã khắc họa một cách tỉ mỉ, từ hoàn cảnh gia đình, sự cố gắng không ngừng cho đến nỗ lực vượt qua những khó khăn, thất bại mà 20 doanh nhân trẻ đã vượt qua. Từ hai bàn tay trắng, với vốn kinh nghiệm, sự hiểu biết và niềm đam mê kinh doanh, họ đã xây dựng nên những công ty, thậm chí là những tập đoàn có tiếng tại Ấn Độ và trên thế giới. Các câu chuyện có thể rất khác nhau nhưng ở một khía cạnh nào đó chúng đều có những nét tương đồng: Những doanh nhân này giành lấy cơ hội cho những điều họ tin tưởng; để rồi đấu tranh và nỗ lực trong nhiều năm sau đó, trước khi kết quả từ những cố gắng ấy đạt đến kích thước và quy mô mà chúng ta gọi là thành công. Trong mỗi câu chuyện như thế, có những người giờ vẫn đang tiếp tục đấu tranh và nỗ lực. Cuốn sách này sẽ mang tới cho họ niềm hy vọng và sức sống mới.\nĐặc biệt, sau mỗi bài viết, tác giả Rashmi Bansal đều rút ra những lời khuyên thiết thực và hữu ích dành cho các doanh nhân trẻ trên cơ sở những kinh nghiệm từ các doanh nhân mà mình đã tiếp xúc. Cuốn sách này giúp truyền cảm hứng cho những sinh viên trẻ mới ra trường, để các bạn có thể nhìn xa hơn cho tương lai của mình, khiến bản thân vượt thoát ra khỏi những rào cản về mong muốn khoản lương hay ước mơ công việc, để định vị giấc mơ của mình.\n",

    "description": "Đây là cuốn sách viết về những người Mỹ làm tốt nhất việc thành lập và phát triển những doanh nghiệp mới. Nó nói về những con người đã phá vỡ những nguyên tắc cũ và tạo ra những nguyên tắc mới, xây dựng nên những thế giới mới, quyết tâm lãnh đạo chứ không chịu bị lãnh đạo, khám phá những công cụ và công nghệ mới khi thời đại của họ mới chỉ mơ hồ ý thức được về chúng để phục vụ cho những thị trường, mà ở chừng mực nào đó, đã được chính họ tạo ra.\nBảy con người được khắc họa chân dung trong cuốn sách này là các cá nhân có động lực và sức cạnh tranh vô cùng lớn lao, họ đã sống trong một đất nước và nền văn hóa khuyến khích những đặc tính này và định hướng họ vào con đường kinh doanh. Mỗi người trong số họ theo cách riêng của mình, là một cá nhân xuất chúng, sống trong một quốc gia cho phép họ bộc lộ đầy đủ tài năng. Những con người ấy ở đất nước này đã được hưởng sự tự do như bất kì ai khác trên thế giới.\nTại sao lại là bảy người này? Lý do quan trọng nhất chính là cuộc đời và sự nghiệp của họ diễn ra trong một thời kì lâu dài. Andrew Carnegie sinh năm 1835. Ông trở thành một thế lực trong thế giới kinh doanh vào thập niên 1860. Tiểu sử của hai người cuối là Sam Walton và Robert Noyce, họ đều qua đời vào thập niên 1990. Vì vậy, sự nghiệp của họ đem lại cơ hội xem xét việc thành lập và phát triển những doanh nghiệp ở Hoa Kỳ đã thay đổi theo thời gian như thế nào.\nBảy tiểu luận về tiểu sử nhân vật trong cuốn sách này dược chia làm ba phần:\nPhần thứ nhất - Carnegie, Eastman và Ford - minh họa cho quá trình chuyển biến của Hoa Kỳ từ một nước đang phát triển tới địa vị lãnh đạo thế giới.\nPhần thứ hai - Watson và Revson - minh họa cho sự lãnh đạo của một nhà marketing công nghiệp (IBM) và một nhà marketing hàng tiêu dùng (Revlon) trong những thập niên giữa thế kỷ XX.\nPhần thứ ba - Walton và Noyce -  nêu ra điểm tương phản giữa một nhà kinh doanh hàng tiêu dùng (Wal-Mart) và một nhà kinh doanh công nghiệp (Intel) cho tới cuối thế kỷ XX. Các tiểu luận này cũng cho thấy những phong cách lãnh đạo khác nhau ở nhân vật đầu tiên (bán lẻ) và nhân vật sau cùng (điện tử bán dẫn).\nBảy chân dung kể trên còn có thể giúp chúng ta khám phá ra những thay đổi cơ bản về nhu cầu lãnh đạo doanh nghiệp kể từ thời kì Nội chiến Mỹ cho tới năm 1990.\nCuộc đời của bảy con người này giống như một chiếc thấu kính, qua đó lịch sử kinh doanh của nước Mỹ sẽ hiển hiện dưới mắt chúng ta.\n",

    "description": "Làm kinh doanh có thể là bất cứ thứ gì mang lại đồng lương cho người sáng lập ra nó nhưng đấy không phải là startup. Startup thì thú vị hơn một chút khi có tiềm năng ảnh hưởng lớn, khả năng cách tân cao và… mức độ không chắc chắn cao. Chỉ cần 7 ngày  để khởi nghiệp thành công - đọc tới đây ắt hẳn sẽ có nhiều bạn đọc nghi ngờ. Tuy nhiên, Dan Norris là minh chứng cho sự thật khó tin đó.\nDan Norris là một doanh nhân đam mê với một nỗi ám ảnh đối với tiếp thị nội dung và được bình chọn top blogger kinh doanh nhỏ của Úc bởi tạp chí kinh doanh lớn nhất nước Úc, thông minh hơn ý tưởng kinh doanh trong năm 2013. Dan cũng là người đồng sáng lập trong WP Curve, một trong những công ty hỗ trợ nhanh nhất thế giới đang phát triển WordPress.\nNhưng ít ai biết được trước khi gặt hái những thành công hiện tại ông đã mất 13 năm thấm nhuần những tư tưởng tẻ nhạt về tinh thần doanh nhân với rất nhiều lần thất bại. Ở tuổi 26,  Dan được thăng chức lên một vị trí quản lý khá nhàn hạ và cuối cùng cũng đã sẵn sàng bắt đầu một doanh nghiệp riêng để khẳng định với các đồng nghiệp của mình rằng \"Tôi sẽ trở thành một triệu phú trước tuổi 30\". Những dự án, những ý tưởng kinh doanh của công ty ông được mọi người ủng hộ, tung hô nhưng sự thật thì chúng đều không sinh lợi nhuận. Chẳng mấy chốc ông trắng tay.\nDan Norris chia sẻ: \"Tôi hành động dựa trên những giả định thay vì đưa ra quyết định dựa trên các thông tin thực tế. Lần duy nhất tôi hành động không dựa trên các giả định là với WP Curve. Tôi đã học được một bài học rất đáng giá từ thất bại khởi nghiệp này. Đó là “Bạn không thể học cho đến khi bạn bắt tay vào làm.\" Chính tinh thần \"không ngại khổ, không ngại khó\" đó  đã cho phép ông điều chỉnh, thay đổi mô hình và liên tiếp giải mã con đường kinh doanh thông qua vô vàn những nỗ lực khởi nghiệp thất bại và cuối cùng cán đích bằng một thành công vượt trội ngoài mong đợi - chính là WP Curve. Và từ việc mất sáu tháng trời để tìm kiếm được vị khách thực sự đầu tiên, ông đã rút ngắn thời gian này xuống còn 7 Ngày.\n7 Ngày Khởi Nghiệp là cuốn sách Dan viết từ chính trải nghiệm của mình trong kinh doanh. Nếu bạn vẫn chưa có một doanh nghiệp riêng, bạn cần phải xây dựng nó, vậy thì cuốn sách này sẽ giúp bạn làm điều đó. Bạn cần phải lăn lộn trong bảy ngày tới để biến ý tưởng thành hành động. Bạn không được làm việc gì khác, ngoại trừ kiên trì xây dựng doanh nghiệp của bạn. Khả năng học hỏi từ thông tin thực tế chính là lý do tại sao cuốn sách  này mang lại hiệu quả. Hãy xóa sạch những giả định khỏi mặt bàn, và tập trung khởi nghiệp trong vòng 7 Ngày.\n",

Dành thời gian tiếp xúc với những người nông dân trên trang trại, các nhà đầu tư mạo hiểm, những người viết kịch bản, các lập trình viên máy tính hành nghề tự do, và những người cho biết mình tìm thấy cảm giác mãn nguyện từ công việc, Newport phát hiện ra những chiến lược họ đã áp dụng và những cạm bẫy họ đã né tránh trong quá trình phát triển sự nghiệp hấp dẫn của mình.\nAnh tiết lộ rằng việc đi tìm một nghề nghiệp phù hợp với một đam mê tồn tại sẵn từ trước là không quan trọng. Đam mê đến sau khi bạn chăm chỉ làm việc để trở nên xuất sắc trong những việc có ích, chứ đam mê không đến trước.\nNói cách khác, cách bạn làm việc thì quan trọng hơn nhiều so với công việc bạn làm.\n",

Rõ ràng, từ nơi tưởng như không có nhu cầu, nếu chịu khó quan sát, phân tích cảm nhận, nhận thức, hành vi và môi trường người tiêu dùng như đề cập trong cuốn sách này sẽ phát hiện nhu cầu hoặc tìm cách kích cầu để kinh doanh thành công.\nSự tác động của môi trường kinh tế, văn hóa, xã hội, công nghệ và chiến lược thương hiệu của đối thủ cạnh tranh đã ảnh hưởng đến cảm nhận, nhận thức, hành vi của người tiêu dùng trong quá trình sử dụng sản phẩm, thay đổi thái độ khi chọn các nhãn hàng, ra quyết định mua hàng linh hoạt, tiếp cận phương tiện truyền thông đa dạng,...\nQua quá trình làm việc gần 20 năm kinh nghiệm tại các doanh nghiệp nước ngoài cũng như hoạt động tư vấn và đào đạo, tác giả đã hoàn thành cuốn sách này. TS. Bùi Văn Quang cũng là tác giả sách \"Quản trị thương hiệu - Lý thuyết và thực tiễn\". Nội dung cuốn sách gồm những kiến thức được cập nhật  mới nhất  trên thế giới vào tình huống thực tế tại Việt Nam, trong đó đề cao phần hướng dẫn vận dụng sau mỗi chương (chiếm trên 1/3 nội dung cuốn sách). Đồng  thời, các chương được lồng ghép các câu chuyện dẫn nhập mở đầu, các ví dụ đan xen trong quá trình phân tích và các tình huống sinh động nhằm tăng tính vận dụng trong thực tiễn.\nPhần vận dụng hướng dẫn bạn đọc cách thức ứng dụng hành vi người tiêu dùng vào thực tế như:\n• Đội ngũ quản lý từ kinh doanh các dịch vụ nhà hàng, cửa hàng bán lẻ, khách sạn, ..đến các doanh nghiệp và tập đoàn cần hiểu người tiêu dùng để kết hợp các bộ phận chuyển tải giá trị vào sản phẩm phù hợp lợi ích người tiêu dùng.\n• Đội ngũ Marketing vận dụng người tiêu dùng vào thực hiện định vị thương hiệu, lựa chọn mô hình kiến trúc thương hiệu, xây dựng hệ thống nhận diện, thực hiện các hoạt động truyền thông, đánh giá thương hiệu và ứng dụng vào thực tế phù hợp với từng môi trường doanh nghiệp.\n• Đội ngũ nhân viên bán hàng tại các cửa hàng đến nhân viên bán hàng sản phẩn đặc thù như xe hơi hoặc dịch vụ bảo hiểm nhân thọ, bán hàng đa cấp hiểu rõ cách thức tìm kiếm, thuyết phục và quản lý người tiêu dùng hiệu quả.\nCuốn sách còn là tài liệu học tập cho sinh viên, học viên cao học, đội ngũ giảng viên và các nhà nghiên cứu quan tâm lĩnh vực này.\nNhận định\n\"Tại sao chúng ta không bán được hàng\" và \"làm thế nào để bán được hàng\"- đó như là hai quan điểm liên quan marketing khác nhau. \"Tại sao chúng ta không bán được hàng\" - là quan điểm marketing của doanh nghiệp Nhật Bản. Để trả lời câu hỏi này, chúng ta phải tìm kiếm giá trị, sáng tạo giá trị và phân phối giá trị vượt trội cho khách hàng hơn đối thủ cạnh tranh.Cuốn sách Hành vi người tiêu dùng - Thấu hiểu và vận dụng đã giải trình nội dung liên quan, từ việc tìm kiếm, sáng tạo và phân phối giá trị cho thị trường. Cuốn sách đã cập nhật được quan điểm mới về marketing thế giới vào nghiên cứu hành vi người tiêu dùng. Chẳng hạn, do nhu cầu người tiêu dùng ngày nay không chỉ giới hạn nhu cầu chức năng mà quan trọng hơn là nhu cầu cảm xúc và nhu cầu tinh thần, nó chi phối hành vi người tiêu dùng,Hoặc là để thỏa mãn nhu cầu người tiêu dùng cần có sự kết hợp hoạt động các bộ phận chức năng của doanh nghiệp nhằm đem đến giá trị cho người tiêu dùng. Cách tiếp cận nội dung các chương có đề cập câu chuyện dẫn nhập, đưa ra các ví dụ liên hệ, cách trình bày này tạo sự hấp dẫn người đọc, làm phong phú nội dung nghiên cứu.Cuốn sách đã bao quát được các lĩnh vực khác nhau liên quan nghiên cứu và ứng dụng hành vi người tiêu dùng. Nó là tài liệu tham khảo cần thiết cho những người kinh doanh cũng như nghiên cứu lãnh vực này.\"\n(PGS. TS.

Tiếp tục với quan điểm về sự tiến bộ trong quá trình nhập môn và chuyển đổi công việc của những nhà lãnh đạo mới, cách tiếp cận chín chắn và đầy cảm hứng tiếp tục được chúng tôi duy trì mạnh mẽ trong suốt hai ấn bản đầu tiên của cuốn sách có hơn 50.000 bản đã được bán trên toàn thế giới này.\nBạn là một vị giám đốc điều hành kì cựu chuẩn bị nắm quyền tại một công ty mới?  Bạn sắp được đảm nhận vai trò mới của một nhà quản trị cấp cơ sở?  Hay bạn đang chuẩn bị kế hoạch cho một cuộc chuyển giao? Cho dù bạn sẽ gia nhập vào một tổ chức mới,  sắp được thăng chức tại nơi đang công tác, hoặc dự định cùng nhóm của bạn ấn nút tái khởi động cho một chu trình làm việc hiệu quả hơn, hay đang vạch ra những triển vọng có thể đến trong tương lai, thì cuốn Sếp mới và kế hoạch 100 ngày lãnh đạo đầu tiên sẽ giúp bạn quản lý được quá trình chuyển giao sự điều hành này để bạn có thể sẵn sàng đảm nhiệm, thành lập đội trợ giúp mình và cho ra kết quả công việc tốt hơn một cách nhanh chóng hơn mọi người vẫn nghĩ.\nNhận định\n\"Tôi rất yêu thích cuốn sách này và tôi ước tôi đã đọc nó trước khi tôi đảm nhận vị trí lãnh đạo như hiện nay. Cuốn sách chỉ cho tôi những đường đi nước bước không thể thiếu để đến được với thành công. Điều này giúp cho những người lãnh đạo  mới biết tận dụng những gì mình có một cách hiệu quả nhất. Hãy đọc cuốn sách này - và đừng trở thành một trong 40% nhà lãnh đạo thất bại ngay từ 18 tháng đầu tiên!\"\n(Sandy Rogers, nguyên Giám đốc Marketing tại công ty \"Proter & Gamble\" và \"Apple Computer\", nguyên Phó Chủ tịch cấp cao tại \"Enterprise Rent - A - Car\")\n“ Sếp mới và kế hoạch 100 ngày lãnh đạo đầu tiên đưa ra rất nhiều công cụ và kĩ năng thực tế cho các nhà lãnh đạo mới. Những nhà lãnh đạo đọc cuốn sách này có thể mong đợi ở những kết quả kinh doanh và xây dựng văn hóa doanh nghiệp rất ấn tượng.”\n(Jon Bonito, Phó Chủ tịch cấp cao tại \"Bank of America\")\n",

Internet đã làm thay đổi không chỉ thói quen tìm kiếm tiếp nhận thông tin mà cả cách chúng ta giao tiếp với nhau. Internet đã hình thành nên những trào lưu thay đổi văn hóa giải trí, ngôn ngữ, giá trị sống. Giờ đây, khi thức dậy, thứ chúng ta chạm vào đầu tiên là chiếc điện thoại di động; chúng ta “đặt câu hỏi” cho Google còn nhiều hơn cho thầy giáo của mình; chúng ta đau khổvì không thể đăng nhập vào Facebook do đứt cáp quang trên biển Đông; chúng ta viết lời chúc mừng sinh nhật trên dòng thời gian của bạn mình thay vì một tấm thiệp được chọn từ nhà sách; và do vậy, có thể nói chúng ta là công dân của kỷ nguyên số.\nTrong Tiếp thị số từ A đến Z, Damian Ryan sẽ dẫn bạn quay trở về quá khứ để tìm hiểu lịch sử của các công nghệ vốn đã làm thay đổi nhân sinh quan của các thế hệ con người. Chính những ảnh hưởng lớn của chúng đến hành vi của con người là thứ dẫn đến nhiều thay đổi lớn trong môi trường kinh doanh. Những mô hình kinh doanh mới liên tục được tạo ra, đời sống kết nối số của người tiêu dùng liên tục tiến hóa và tất nhiên là kéo theo những cách thức tiếp thị mới, hiện đại ra đời.\nTuy nhiên, tiếp thị số không có nghĩa là đơn thuần truyền thông điệp bằng cách chặn giữa luồng tiếp nhận thông tin qua các phương tiện số như mô hình tiếp thị truyền thống đã áp dụng cho báo giấy, tivi và radio. Tiếp thị số cũng không chỉ là việc lựa chọn các kênh mới nhằm tiếp cận người tiêu dùng. Mà đó còn là hoạt động dõi theo hành trình khách hàng trong kỷ nguyên số, thấu hiểu những điểm giao tiếp với họ trên cả không gian số và không gian vật lý, tạo nên những trải nghiệm đáng nhớ để tận dụng sức mạnh lan tỏa, giá trị ảnh hưởng của từng khách hàng trên không gian số của chính họ.\nKhái niệm tiếp thị số giờ đây đã không còn xa lạ với những người làm tiếp thị. Từ những công ty đa quốc gia cho đến các cửa hàng nhỏ, tiếp thị số đã trở thành một phương pháp chứng minh được sự hiệu quả. Từ chỗ nghi ngờ và dè dặt, trong 3 năm trở lại đây, tiếp thị số đã trở thành một phần không thể thiếu trong kế hoạch tiếp thị tích hợp. Thật hiếm có những cuốn sách như cuốn này của Damian Ryan, tích luỹ một cách đầy đủ, như chính cái tên của nó, các mô hình tiếp thị số. Ở đầu mỗi chương, tác giả đưa ra cam kết về những thông tin bạn sẽ nhận được trong suốt chương sách và rồi ở cuối chương, bạn sẽ thấy hài lòng.\nRyan cũng đưa đến cho bạn những thông tin cập nhật rất mới về định nghĩa, cách thức triển khai, mô hình quản lý của từng công cụ, giúp bạn không chỉ có khả năng lựa chọn những công cụ tiếp thị số phù hợp mà còn hiểu và định hình được chiến lược số cho doanh nghiệp của mình. Đây là cuốn sách xứng đáng nằm trên kệ của mỗi người làm tiếp thị tại Việt Nam, như một cuốn từ điển chuyên ngành nhỏ mà bạn có thể tra cứu.\n",

Năm 1997, cuốn này đã được xuất bản với tên gọi “Kính Thiên Ái Người”.

Inamori Kazuo  cảm thấy rằng nên bổ sung để cuốn sách hoàn chỉnh hơn. Không chỉ làm sao để người đọc có thể kinh doanh tốt mà còn làm sao để cho họ có thể sống một cuộc đời có ý nghĩa hơn, không chỉ làm sao để xã hội phát triển mà việc tạo ra một cuộc sống tuyệt vời cho mỗi cá nhân cũng rất cần thiết.

Hãy đọc Kinh Thánh thật kỹ và dưới một góc độ khác, bạn sẽ thấy đây còn là một bộ sưu tập vĩ đại nhất về tài năng lãnh đạo qua các trường hợp cụ thể, với những bài học vô cùng bổ ích và sâu sắc dành cho các nhà lãnh đạo và quản lý ngày nay. Cho dù tín ngưỡng tôn giáo của chúng ta là gì thì phần lớn những người sống ở Tây bán cầu đều quá quen thuộc với những câu chuyện và những người anh hùng trong Kinh Thánh. Chính những câu chuyện và những nhân vật này đã tạo nên một số hình mẫu điển hình nhất trong hệ tư tưởng chung của chúng ta và còn có thể là những hình mẫu mang tính toàn cầu về khả năng lãnh đạo tài tình nhất (và cũng tệ hại nhất).\nKinh Thánh nói rất nhiều về những con người này cũng như những nhà lãnh đạo khác - những nhà vua, nhà tiên tri, các chiến binh, các vị tham mưu và những người biết nhìn xa trông rộng. Đây là chuyện tiên đoán đúng và sai, những của cải được và mất, những tổ chức ra đời và sụp đổ. Người ta có thể còn ngờ vực tính nguyên bản của Kinh Thánh, nhưng những bài học và câu chuyện trong cuốn Kinh Thánh này đã được coi là những nguyên mẫu chung có ảnh hưởng lớn tới cung cách con người chúng ta sinh sống theo một mức độ tâm lý, tôn giáo và biểu tượng sâu sắc.\nVậy tại sao chúng ta lại không áp dụng sự thông thái về lãnh đạo trong cuốn Kinh Thánh này vào kinh doanh? Chẳng có gì đáng ngạc nhiên nếu những đức tính và kỹ năng của những nhà lãnh đạo thành công thời Kinh Thánh cũng chính là những đức tính và kỹ năng có thể thấy ở các nhà lãnh đạo thành đạt nhất ngày nay. Cuốn sách này chủ yếu tập trung vào kinh doanh, và phần lớn những trường hợp đưa ra nghiên cứu ở đây đều là những câu chuyện về kinh doanh. Nhưng trong Kinh Thánh còn có những bài học dành cho các nhà lãnh đạo chính trị, thể thao, nghệ thuật và thậm chí cả tôn giáo nữa. Bạn sẽ thấy cuốn sách này rất hữu ích cho dù bạn đang lãnh đạo một doanh nghiệp, một ủy ban chính trị hay một lực lượng đặc nhiệm, một đội vận động viên thể thao, một dàn nhạc giao hưởng, hay một tổ chức tôn giáo nào đó như nhà thờ hay giáo đường (bởi bạn đang nắm trong tay một trong những công cụ quản lý hàng đầu thế giới - Kinh Thánh).\n",

    "description": "Tại sao bạn muốn trở thành nhà lãnh đạo? Vì bạn muốn được giữ vai trò chỉ đạo hàng chục, hàng trăm, thậm chí hàng ngàn nhân viên? Bạn muốn được thể hiện khả năng kiểm soát? Bạn muốn tạo ra giá trị? Tập trung vào tương lai? Là chính mình? Vì lợi nhuận? Có thể những lý do đó đều đúng. Nhưng ngoài những yếu tố trên, yêu cầu về trách nhiệm đối với nhà lãnh đạo cũng cao không kém.\nTheo thống kê, 60% các công ty tại Mỹ đang phải đối mặt với việc thiếu hụt các tài năng lãnh đạo, khiến hiệu suất công việc bị giảm sút. Chỉ có 40% nhân viên hiểu được mục tiêu, tầm nhìn, chiến lược của công ty; 43% nhân viên trung thành nhận được phản hồi hàng tuần từ sếp, và có đến 75% nhân viên nghỉ việc không vì công việc mà vì sếp. Những con số thống kê trên cho thấy vai trò của nhà lãnh đạo trong một công ty hay tổ chức là vô cùng quan trọng. Thành công của một doanh nghiệp, ngoài sự cố gắng phấn đấu của từng nhân viên thì giữ vai trò quan trọng vẫn là tài năng của nhà lãnh đạo.\nSimon Sinek, tác giả của cuốn sách New York Times bestseller Lãnh đạo luôn ăn sau cùng (Leaders eat last), đã đúc rút lại trong cuốn sách một thông điệp đơn giản nhưng chính xác: “Nếu hành động của bạn truyền cảm hứng cho những người khác dám mơ ước nhiều hơn, học hỏi nhiều hơn, làm nhiều hơn và phát triển hơn, thì bạn là một nhà lãnh đạo.”\nBạn hãy thử tưởng tượng về một thế giới, nơi mà hàng ngày mọi người thức giấc, có cảm hứng đi làm, cảm thấy tin tưởng và được coi trọng ở nơi làm việc, và cuối ngày họ trở về nhà với cảm giác hài lòng với công việc. Ngày nay, trong nhiều tổ chức thành công, những nhà lãnh đạo tuyệt vời nhất đang tạo ra môi trường làm việc, trong đó mọi người kết hợp với nhau thành một nhóm hết sức tự nhiên để tạo ra những sản phẩm vượt trội.\n“Khi con người phải xoay xở với những nguy hiểm bên trong thì khả năng đối mặt với những nguy hiểm từ bên ngoài tổ chức sẽ suy giảm”. Nghệ thuật lãnh đạo con người đích thực sẽ bảo vệ tổ chức khỏi những tranh giành bên trong tổ chức, những thứ rất có thể sẽ phá hỏng văn hóa doanh nghiệp. Khi chúng ta bảo vệ mình khỏi những người khác, thì chính tổ chức sẽ bị thiệt hại. Nhưng khi sự tin tưởng và tinh thần hợp tác phát triển trong tổ chức, chúng ta sẽ kéo mọi người gần nhau hơn và tổ chức sẽ được phát triển bền vững hơn. Khi chúng ta phải đấu tranh để tìm niềm vui hay một cảm giác thân thuộc tại nơi làm việc, chúng ta sẽ mang cuộc đấu tranh  đó về nhà. Những người có cơ hội làm việc tại những tổ chức, mà ở đó họ đối xử với người lao động như một người thực sự được bảo vệ chứ không phải nguồn lực để khai thác, thì đến cuối ngày họ trở về nhà với một cảm giác vui vẻ và lòng biết ơn. Đây là nguyên tắc cho tất cả chúng ta chứ không phải ngoại lệ. Sau khi làm việc, chúng ta cảm thấy được truyền cảm hứng, cảm thấy an toàn, biết ơn là những quyền lợi tự nhiên của con người mà chúng ta được hưởng, chứ không phải một điều sang trọng, xa xỉ mà chỉ những người may mắn mới tìm thấy.\nCó nhiều bài học dành cho các nhà lãnh đạo và với vai trò là người dẫn dắt một tổ chức, nhà lãnh đạo ngày càng có nhiều vai trò hơn trong việc xây dựng văn hóa công ty, lãnh đạo nhân viên, tạo ra một môi trường làm việc có sự bảo vệ từ “phía trên” để nhân viên yên tâm và tiếp tục cống hiến cho chính tổ chức đó. Một cách tự nhiên, con người sẽ sẵn sàng làm theo lãnh đạo do gắn bó về mặt tình cảm, trong khi người quản lý được cấp dưới vâng lời là do thẩm quyền chính thức được trao cho họ. Và kết quả, mọi người có xu hướng trung thành hơn với nhà lãnh đạo thay vì nhà quản lý. Đó chính là một nhà lãnh đạo thành công.\n",

    "description": "Bạn đang muốn phát triển khả năng lãnh đạo của bản thân? Cho dù bạn đã là một lãnh đạo lão làng muốn mài dũa thêm các kỹ năng lãnh đạo của mình. Hay có thể bạn đang phải đối mặt với những thách thức với vai trò lãnh đạo mà bạn đang trải qua một thời gian khó khăn để giải quyết. Hay bạn là một “lính mới” trong một môi trường mới và mong muốn tạo sự khác biệt bằng cách tăng cường tầm ảnh hưởng của mình. Tất cả những mong muốn này đều là những mục tiêu “đáng giá”.\nCho dù lý do của bạn là gì, tôi rất vui lòng chia sẻ với bạn bản kế hoạch 90 ngày này nhằm giúp cải thiện kỹ năng lãnh đạo của bạn. Vì sao ư? Vì Mọi việc thăng hay trầm là do sự lãnh đạo. Nếu bạn muốn tạo dựng ảnh hưởng tốt với thế giới, việc học cách lãnh đạo tốt hơn sẽ giúp bạn thực hiện việc này.\nTrở thành lãnh đạo là một trong những niềm đam mê của tôi. Tôi đã đi trên hành trình lãnh đạo suốt 50 năm qua và sẽ cống hiến cả cuộc đời mình để chia sẻ với mọi người về những gì tôi học được về cách lãnh đạo. Tôi bắt đầu hành trình khám phá của mình với việc đặt ra rất nhiều câu hỏi mà có lẽ bạn cũng đã và đang tự hỏi chính mình:\nThế nào là một nhà lãnh đạo?\nNên định nghĩa khái niệm lãnh đạo như thế nào?\nKhả năng lãnh đạo bắt đầu từ đâu?\nMình nên làm gì trước?\nLàm thế nào để mình có thể gây ảnh hưởng tới người khác nhiều hơn?\nLàm thế nào để xây dựng một đội nhóm hiệu quả?\nLàm thế nào để mình trở thành một người lãnh đạo giỏi hơn?\nĐôi khi rất khó trả lời các câu hỏi về khả năng lãnh đạo. Tuy nhiên, đây không hẳn là một vấn đề dễ gây rối trí hay quá cao siêu. Trên thực tế, bất kỳ ai cũng có thể học cách trở thành một lãnh đạo giỏi hơn. Vì sao tôi có thể nói như vậy? Vì khả năng lãnh đạo chính là sức ảnh hưởng. Nếu bạn có thể tạo ra ảnh hưởng đến người khác nhiều hơn, bạn có thể lãnh đạo hiệu quả hơn.\nThông thường nhiều người cho rằng sự cải thiện khả năng lãnh đạo liên quan đến con đường sự nghiệp của họ. Đây là một quan điểm sai lầm. Những gì bạn nên nghĩ đến chính là việc phát triển khả năng lãnh đạo của bản thân. Dấu hiệu của sự lãnh đạo xuất sắc không nằm ở sự thăng tiến cá nhân. Mà đó là sự phát triển đội nhóm của bạn. Khi những thành viên khác thành công và đội nhóm của bạn làm việc hiệu quả hơn, đó mới chính là dấu hiệu chứng tỏ khả năng lãnh đạo của bạn được cải thiện.\n",

Việc các doanh nghiệp đua nhau đầu tư tiền tỉ và làm nên chiến dịch quảng bá công phu và hoành tráng đã và đang khẳng định sự phát triển đột phá cũng như vai trò quan trọng của quảng cáo trong kinh doanh, khiến cho lĩnh vực này càng lúc càng bành trướng. Quả thật, không biết làm quảng cáo thì đừng nói đến chuyện kinh doanh thành công.\nQuảng cáo còn phải là một công cụ đáng được các nhà kinh doanh khao khát, tận dụng và đủ sức “quyến rũ” đám đông người tiêu dùng, nếu không, chúng ta chẳng cần quảng cáo để làm gì. Thật ra, không nhiều người trong chúng ta quan tâm tìm hiểu xem quyền năng của quảng cáo thực sự đến từ đâu, và làm thế nào nó có thể phát huy hiệu quả.\nHiện tại đã có nhiều cuốn sách hay viết về phương pháp làm quảng cáo. Nhưng Quảng Cáo Quyến Rũ của Pierre Martineau là quyển sách đầu tiên làm công việc khai phá bí ẩn đằng sau những mẩu quảng cáo, bóc trần những nguyên do và cơ chế “quyến rũ” người tiêu dùng của quảng cáo nhằm mục đích xác định những tiêu chí làm nên một mẩu quảng cáo thành công; cũng như làm thế nào để nó hiệu quả hơn thế nữa. Để làm được việc này, cuốn sách này sẽ nghiên cứu và tiếp cận người tiêu dùng với tư cách là những con người bình thường dưới góc nhìn của các ngành khoa học xã hội.\nQuảng Cáo Quyến Rũ là một tác phẩm để đời của Martineau, trong đó, ông không chỉ “bật mí” cho chúng ta những sự thật giật mình về nghệ thuật xui khiến người tiêu dùng phải mua bằng được sản phẩm của bạn, mà còn là một cuốn sách hiếm hoi vạch trần cho chúng ta bản chất của nghề quảng cáo thông qua việc phân tích và giải đáp những vấn đề như:\nNhà quảng cáo là những ai?\nCông việc của họ thực chất là gì?\nLà nhà quảng cáo, chúng ta có những nhiệm vụ và sứ mệnh như thế nào?\nLàm thế nào để trở thành nhà quảng cáo giỏi?\nNhà quảng cáo giỏi và nhà quảng cáo tồi, đâu là điểm khác biệt thực sự giữa họ?\n\n",

Khi nói đến việc khích lệ, nhiều lãnh đạo sẽ nghĩ ngay đến khích lệ nhân viên bằng tiền. Mặc dù chúng ta không coi thường hay phủ nhận chế độ và chính sách thưởng tiền hợp lí và khoa học của một số doanh nghiệp, nhưng việc đãi ngộ bằng lương, tiền không thể giải quyết được mọi vấn đề. Một là, lương thưởng không phải là nguyên nhân duy nhất ảnh hưởng đến lòng yêu nghề của nhân viên, thậm chí không phải là nguyên nhân quan trọng nhất. Hai là, người quản lí có phát huy được khả năng lãnh đạo của mình hay không sẽ có ảnh hưởng rất lớn đến lòng yêu nghề của nhân viên.\nCuốn sách này kết hợp một số vấn đề thường gặp trong quá trình giảng dạy cho các doanh nhân của tác giả, giải thích tỉ mỉ 12 phương pháp khích lệ nhân viên không dùng đến tiền, từ đó giới thiệu tường tận phương pháp và cách thức khích lệ nhân viên khác nhau từ nhân viên mới, nhân viên giàu kinh nghiệm, nhân viên làm việc tận tụy và nhân viên cốt cán của công ty. Cuốn sách chính là vũ khí đắc lực, là gợi ý hiệu quả để những người quản lí doanh nghiệp học hỏi và nắm bắt, thúc đẩy doanh nghiệp phát triển bền vững, giúp nhân viên của họ ngày càng trưởng thành và tiến bộ. Tác giả hi vọng cuốn sách sẽ giúp ích cho các nhà quản lí doanh nghiệp thúc đẩy lợi ích doanh nghiệp, khiến nhân viên làm việc tận tụy, gắn bó và xây dựng doanh nghiệp phát triển hiệu quả.\n",

    "description": "Thay đổi công việc được đánh giá là một trong những trải nghiệm khó khăn nhất của cuộc đời. Tuy nhiên, thực tế có rất ít người trong chúng ta chỉ suốt đời làm một công việc từ lúc tốt nghiệp, vì vậy, dù lúc này hay lúc khác, bất cứ ai cũng sẽ phải trải qua việc thay đổi công việc. Vậy làm thế nào để bạn có thể tận dụng tốt nhất khi phải thay đổi công việc trong thời kì kinh tế khủng hoảng này, để đảm bảo bạn sẽ có được công việc bạn yêu thích, chứ không phải chấp nhận bất cứ công việc nào bạn tìm được?\nCông việc chiếm một phần ba cuộc đời chúng ta, là thứ chúng ta làm mỗi ngày cho tới tận lúc nghỉ hưu. Ai lại muốn dành một phần ba ngày của mình một cách không hạnh phúc để làm một công việc khiến bạn chán ghét? Đa số chúng ta không thích sự thay đổi, đặc biệt là thay đổi lớn trong nghề nghiệp, mặc cho việc không hài lòng với công việc hiện tại đang gây ảnh hưởng tới mọi mặt của cuộc sống, tác động tiêu cực tới quan hệ cá nhân và khiến gia đình chúng ta cũng chịu ảnh hưởng xấu. Không những thế, việc không hài lòng với công việc còn gây tác động xấu tới sức khỏe. Cuốn sách này sẽ giúp bạn có được việc làm bạn mong muốn. Nó sẽ không cung cấp những kỹ năng chuyên môn cho bạn - điều này bạn nên tìm tới các trường đại học và dạy nghề. Điều cuốn sách đem lại là các kỹ năng hiệu quả giúp công cuộc tìm việc của bạn trở nên nhẹ nhàng và giúp hồ sơ xin việc của bạn nhận được phản hồi tích cực từ nhà tuyển dụng.\nBất kể khi nền kinh tế gặp khủng hoảng hay hưng thịnh, tìm việc luôn là một nhiệm vụ không dễ dàng. Điều này đúng kể cả khi tỉ lệ thất nghiệp của nền kinh tế thấp. Thậm chí trong thời kì bùng nổ kinh tế, trung bình cũng thường mất khoảng 3 tháng để tìm việc. Việc hiểu rõ quy trình tuyển dụng, giữ thái độ lạc quan và tự tin trở nên càng quan trọng hơn khi nền kinh tế rơi vào thời kì khó khăn. Nếu so sánh với thời gian làm việc cả đời, thời gian bạn bỏ ra để tìm việc chỉ chiếm một phần rất nhỏ. Như vậy, đầu tư thời gian và sức lực để tìm việc một cách hiệu quả sẽ giúp nỗ lực của bạn được đền đáp xứng đáng nhiều năm sau đó. Các nghiên cứu đã chứng minh rằng, những người hiểu rõ và làm tốt khâu tìm việc thường có chỉ số hài lòng với công việc cao hơn, và có thu nhập cao hơn trong sự nghiệp của mình. Tập trung cho quá trình tìm việc không những giúp cuộc sống thỏa mãn hơn, mà còn thu được mức lương cao hơn. Tuy nhiên, do tìm kiếm công việc không phải điều chúng ta thường xuyên làm, nên chúng ta không có nhiều kinh nghiệm. Chỉ có một số ít người biết cách viết một bản lí lịch hay, hoặc biết các tạo ấn tượng trong buổi phỏng vấn.\nCuốn sách này được viết dành cho tất cả những ai đang trải qua quá trình tìm việc, hoặc đang có ý định thay đổi công việc. Nếu bạn đang tìm kiếm một cơ hội tốt hơn, nếu bạn vừa tốt nghiệp và lần đầu tìm việc, hoặc nếu bạn bị buộc phải tìm việc do cắt giảm nhân sự ở công ty cũ, đây sẽ là cuốn sách hữu ích hướng dẫn bạn trả lời những câu hỏi căn bản nhất để tìm được một công việc tuyệt vời.\n",

Bất chấp tất cả, đồng tiền đã lên ngôi, và sự lên ngôi của đồng tiền là thiết yếu cho sự lên ngôi của loài người, đưa con người từ mức sống khốn khổ lên đỉnh cao của sự thịnh vượng vật chất.\nQua những sự kiện lịch sử vừa vinh quang vừa tăm tối, cùng những nhân vật lẫy lừng vừa có khả năng sáng tạo vừa có khả năng hủy diệt trong thế giới tài chính, Đồng tiền lên ngôi kể câu chuyện hấp dẫn về tiền tệ và tín dụng, thị trường trái phiếu cva cổ phiếu, về bảo hiểm và bất động sản - những thành tố then chốt của nền tài chính - từ thời Lưỡng hà cổ đại tới đầu thế kỉ 21, với những cuộc khai sinh, bước tiến đến đỉnh cao, những cơn khủng hoảng và bài học đắt giá.

    "description": "Tư duy chiến lược (Lý thuyết trò chơi thực hành) tóm gọn nghệ thuật tư duy đúng đắn, được áp dụng trong mọi bối cảnh khác nhau của cuộc sống, giúp bạn vượt lên đối thủ, trong khi biết rằng đối thủ cũng đang làm điều tương tự với mình. Cuốn sách là tác phẩm để đời của hai nhà kinh tế học Avinash K.Dixit và Barry J.Nalebuff.\nNền tảng của \"tư duy chiến lược” bao gồm một số nguyên tắc cơ bản đơn giản, là căn nguyên của ngành khoa học chiến lược. Những nguyên tắc ấy hoàn toàn có thể giúp bất cứ ai, dù thuộc tầng lớp xã hội nào, làm ngành nghề gì, cũng có thể trở thành những chiến lược gia có nghề.\nNgành khoa học của tư duy chiến lược mà chúng tôi muốn nói đến được gọi là lý thuyết trò chơi (game theory) - là một ngành khoa học non trẻ được hình thành khoảng 50 năm. Giống như mọi ngành khoa học khác, tư duy chiến lược được biểu hiện bằng các biệt ngữ và toán học. Đây chính là điểm hạn chế của ngành, bởi nó không cho phép tất cả mọi người, ngoại trừ các chuyên gia, hiểu được những ý tưởng cơ bản. Trong cuốn sách Tư duy chiến lược - Lý thuyết trò chơi thực hành, hai tác giả Avinash K.Dixit và Barry J.Nalebuff đã cố gắng cụ thể hóa tất cả các lý thuyết toán học và các biệt ngữ bằng các tình huống gần gũi với cuộc sống, bên cạnh một phần số học, các đồ thị và bảng biểu.\nCuốn sách này không giới hạn các ý tưởng trong bất cứ tình huống cụ thể nào mà đưa ra rất nhiều ví dụ minh họa cho mỗi nguyên tắc cơ bản. Việc đưa ra các tình huống đa dạng giúp bạn đọc thuộc nhiều nghề nghiệp, tầng lớp xã hội khác nhau tìm thấy được những điểm quen thuộc, đồng thời họ cũng sẽ tự tìm ra mối liên hệ thông qua các tình huống đó. \"Tư duy chiến lược” đã mang đến cho nhiều người một cách nhìn mới về mọi sự kiện, hiện tượng trong xã hội, kể từ văn học, phim ảnh và thể thao cho đến các sự kiện chính trị, lịch sử.\nKhông hề khô khan như nhiều cuốn sách mang nặng tính học thuyết khác, Tư duy chiến lược diễn biến theo kiểu kể chuyện. Nguồn gốc xưa của nó là một khóa học về \"trò chơi chiến lược” mà Avinash Dixit triển khai và dạy tại Trường Woodrow Wilson về Các vấn đề cộng đồng và quốc tế thuộc Đại học Princeton. Barry J.Nalebuff sau đó dạy khóa học này, và dạy một khóa học tương tự ở khoa Khoa học chính trị của Đại học Yale và sau đó là tại Trường Tổ chức và Quản trị (SOM) thuộc Đại học Yale.\nĐến nay, Tư duy chiến lược - Lý thuyết trò chơi thực hành đã trở thành cẩm nang quen thuộc của nhiều người, nhờ vào tính đúng đắn và khả năng ứng dụng cao trong thực tiễn đời sống của nó.\nNhà kinh tế học Paul Samuelson - người đạt giải Nobel Kinh tế 1970 từng nhận xét: \"Để hiểu biết về hiện tại, bạn cần một sự hiểu biết khái quát về Lý thuyết trò chơi. Dixit và Nalebuff đã cung cấp cho bạn những chìa khoá cốt yếu. Bạn sẽ gặt hái được nhiều điều bổ ích và thú vị từ cuốn sách này...”\n",

    "description": "Xét trên nhiều khía cạnh, công việc kinh doanh là tổng thể hàng loạt quyết định liên quan đến việc định hình phương hướng hoạt động của mọi tổ chức. Có những quyết định nếu được thực hiện đúng thời điểm sẽ tạo bước ngoặt to lớn đối với sự thành công và phát triển của một công ty, đồng thời còn giúp công ty duy trì vị thế cạnh tranh trên thương trường. Điển hình là quyết định tung brochure quảng cáo cho iPod - thiết bị lưu trữ nhạc kỹ thuật số của Apple. Chính quyết định sáng suốt này đã làm Apple hồi sinh và giá trị cổ phiếu trên thị trường chứng khoán nhanh chóng tăng vọt.\nTrong khi đó, những quyết định tệ hại thường kéo theo những hậu quả đắt giá. Năm 1995, Walt Disney tuyển Michael Ovitz vào vị trí Chủ tịch. Chưa đầy một năm sau, Disney đã phải hối tiếc về sự lựa chọn của mình và cho Ovitz thôi việc với khoản đền bù lên tới 140 triệu đô la - một số tiền quá lớn để trả giá cho một quyết định tồi tệ.\nHai lý do chính khiến người lãnh đạo đưa ra quyết định kém. Thứ nhất, họ không có đầy đủ dữ kiện thông tin cần thiết cho tình huống hiện tại; thứ hai, họ không thể dự đoán chính xác những diễn biến bất ngờ trong tương lai. Trong nhiều trường hợp, sự thất bại của quyết định sẽ đem đến nhiều kinh nghiệm, bài học giá trị cho người lãnh đạo nhưng vẫn rất cần những quyết định đúng đắn ngay từ ban đầu.\nVậy làm thế nào để khả năng ra quyết định đạt đến mức độ chính xác và hoàn hảo? Dù biết rằng sự hoàn hảo là điều không bao giờ có thể xảy ra nhưng ta hoàn toàn có thể tiến dần đến điểm lý tưởng này nếu có phương pháp hợp lý để ra quyết định và ý thức về những cạm bẫy có thể gặp phải trong quá trình xem xét các phương án đề xuất để đưa ra quyết định cuối cùng.\nCuốn Kỹ năng ra quyết định trong bộ Cẩm nang Kinh doanh Harvard trình bày một quy trình quyết định hợp lý, đã được thử nghiệm qua thời gian - một quy trình có thể áp dụng cho hầu như bất kỳ tình huống phức tạp nào. Quy trình này bao gồm các công cụ giúp đánh giá, lựa chọn những phương án tốt nhất để đạt được mục tiêu của mình, đồng thời còn giúp hạn chế nhược điểm cá nhân và biết cách tổ chức việc ra quyết định. Và cuối cùng, cuốn sách sẽ hướng dẫn cách chuyển biến việc ra quyết định hiệu quả thành một thói quen trong tổ chức.\n",

    "description": "Hầu hết chúng ta đều muốn làm nhiều thứ và để làm được những điều mình mong muốn, nhưng thời gian của mỗi người là hữu hạn. Trung bình, mỗi người trong cuộc đời chỉ có khoảng 60 năm, vì thế quản lý thời gian hiệu quả là một trong những nhiệm vụ quan trọng nhất của con người.\nVậy quản lý thời gian là gì? Tổng quát mà nói, quản lý thời gian là một quá trình kiểm soát thời gian bạn sử dụng cho những hoạt động cụ thể trong cuộc đời mình. Nói nôm na dễ hiểu, việc phân chia 24 giờ một ngày cho những công việc khác nhau chính là một hoạt động quản lý thời gian. Nhưng quản lý thời gian không giới hạn trong hoạt động phân bổ thời gian một ngày mà có thể là một tháng, sáu tháng, một năm hoặc dài hơn. Thời đoạn lựa chọn sẽ tùy thuộc vào cá nhân mỗi người.\nVậy thế nào là quản lý thời gian hiệu quả? Hiệu quả được tính khi bạn đạt được mục tiêu mình mong muốn bằng cách sử dụng ít nguồn lực nhất. Theo đó, trong góc nhìn về quản lý thời gian, bạn quản lý thời gian hiệu quả khi đạt được những mục tiêu cá nhân bằng ít thời gian nhất.\nCuốn sách Bản đồ tư duy trong quản lý thời gian sẽ giới thiệu cho bạn phương pháp quản lý thời gian hiệu quả nhất bằng cách ứng dụng bản đồ tư duy vào phạm trù này. Bạn sẽ biết cách sử dụng thời gian, đặc biệt là thời gian rảnh rỗi một cách tốt nhất cho sự phát triển của bản thân, mà vẫn giữ được sự cân bằng trong cuộc sống, giữa làm việc và thư giãn, đặc biệt là trị được căn bệnh lười biếng, không có mục tiêu của mình để trở thành người hạnh phúc hơn và thành công hơn trong cuộc sống.\n",

    "description": "Thuyết trình là một trong những kỹ năng quan trọng trong công việc và cuộc sống. Có rất nhiều người trong đầu chứa đựng đầy ắp ý tưởng hay nhưng không bao giờ có thể trình bày một cách hiệu quả. Vài người khác dù chẳng tài giỏi bằng, nhưng lại có thể nói hay đến mức chinh phục lòng người. Vậy bí quyết thuyết trình là gì? Làm thế nào để có được một bài thuyết trình tốt? Cuốn sách này sẽ giúp bạn chuẩn bị từng bước để nâng cao hiệu quả thuyết trình bằng cách sử dụng bản đồ tư duy.\nRất nhiều người cho rằng con người đang tạo ra nhiều phương thức để giao tiếp hiệu quả hơn. Mạng xã hội, những chiếc điện thoại thông minh với nhiều chức năng hay thư điện tử giúp tăng tầng suất giao tiếp giữa người với người. Xu hướng toàn cầu hóa giúp chúng ta giờ đây có thể dễ dàng giao tiếp với những cư dân ở các đất nước khác khi khác biệt văn hóa không còn là một rào cản lớn nữa. Tuy nhiên, theo quan sát của chúng tôi, những phát kiến mới của con người cũng thêm sự phức tạp vào môi trường và hệ thống mã hóa mà chúng ta đang sử dụng. Một ví dụ điển hình là sự giao thoa văn hóa tạo ra một hệ thống ngôn ngữ mới mà giới trẻ ưa chuộng. Tính sẵn có của thông tin khiến chúng ta bị quá tải và từ đó việc sắp xếp thông tin khi truyền tải đôi lúc trở nên lộn xộn.\nVì giao tiếp đóng vai trò quan trọng trong đời sống con người và môi trường đang phức tạp hóa giao tiếp, một trong những chủ đề đáng quan tâm ngày nay là làm sao cải thiện kỹ năng giao tiếp. Trong quyển sách này, chúng tôi sẽ không hướng dẫn chung chung về giao tiếp mà tập trung vào một hình thái giao tiếp quan trọng - thuyết trình. Hình thái này được sử dụng rộng rãi trong công việc và cuộc sống và do đó nó là vấn đề rất đáng để bạn quan tâm.\nThuyết trình là quá trình truyền tải những suy nghĩ của bạn đến mọi người. Suy nghĩ càng thông suốt rõ ràng thì người nghe càng dễ nắm bắt. Vì thế, bản đồ tư duy là một công cụ hỗ trợ đắc lực hoạt động thuyết trình. Quyển sách này sẽ hướng dẫn bạn cách thức vận dụng bản đồ tư duy để nâng cao hiệu quả của thuyết trình.\n",

    "description": "“Theo bạn đâu là mục đích của công việc?”\nCâu trả lời phổ biến nhất có lẽ là “để tìm kiếm niềm vui trong cuộc sống”. Nhưng nếu câu hỏi này được thay đổi đi một chút thành “Lý do bạn bước ra khỏi nhà và đi làm ngày hôm nay là gì?” thì chưa biết chừng lần này “Tiền” lại là câu trả lời chiếm giữ vị trí số một. Hãy đừng để mục đích tiền bạc vượt lên trên ý nghĩa của công việc bạn đang làm.\nMột “công việc tốt” chính là công việc giúp bạn tìm thấy được niềm vui trong đó, đồng thời cảm nhận được sự đóng góp hữu ích của mình cho xã hội. Cuốn sách có thể được coi như một sách lược dành cho tất cả những ai đang mong muốn có một nghề nghiệp với sự nghiệp thực sự chứ không chỉ mang ý nghĩa một chỗ làm đơn thuần.\n",

Chính Steve Jobs đã dẫn dắt Apple giành được những thành quả to lớn ấy. Không những thế, chính ông còn tạo cho Apple những ý nghĩa tốt đẹp về mặt tinh thần, biến Apple là một hãng sản xuất máy tính rất độc đáo. Bởi vậy, những người hâm mộ Apple, gồm các thế hệ, luôn đam mê ông và sản phẩm của ông.\nQua các bài viết của truyền thông đại chúng, chúng ta dễ dàng nắm bắt được những tính cách rất đặc trưng của Steve Jobs: Steve Jobs là người rất chuyên tâm, theo chủ nghĩa hoàn hảo, thông minh, nhanh nhẹn, quyết đoán... Steve Jobs luôn có những ý tưởng hết sức độc đáo về kinh doanh, cũng như phương án thiết kế sản phẩm và tiêu chuẩn dùng người.

Steve Jobs đã biến cuộc đời mình thành một câu chuyện thần thoại sống động theo kiểu nói của Hemingway: \"Anh có thể đánh bại tôi, nhưng không bao giờ khiến tôi gục ngã\".

    "description": "Chắc chắn Thủy Hử @ không phải là cuốn tiểu thuyết ăn theo của Thủy Hử. Nó là một cuốn sách luận bàn về kinh doanh, mượn chi tiết của lịch sử để bàn về vấn đề kinh doanh hiện nay.\nỞ đó, dưới ngòi bút hóm hỉnh của Thành Quân Ức, tất cả các nhân vật trong Thủy hử như Lâm Xung, Vương Tiễn, Lỗ Chí Thâm, Võ Tòng, Chu Quý…. đã nhảy vào thương trường kinh doanh. Những chi tiết đan xen giữa nội dung cốt truyện và tình huống kinh doanh thời hiện đại sẽ giúp bạn thấy được sự sắc sảo, tài tình của tác giả. Những suy nghĩ, hành động của người xưa không hề lệch so với thương trường ngày nay.\nAnh chàng Lâm Xung sau khi thất thế, phải lưu lạc nơi giang hồ. Nhưng ai ngờ giang hồ hiểm ác, mưu sinh vất vả, khó khăn nằm ngoài sức tưởng tượng của anh. Anh tìm việc khắp nơi, nhưng đến đâu cũng gặp phải trở ngại, khó khăn. Cảm giác thất bại khiến anh bực bội vô cùng. Thật ra tìm việc không khó, cái khó là tìm được công việc tử tế. Từ xưa đến nay anh hùng luôn không chịu lùi bước trước khó khăn. Đã là một người đàn ông, một người đàn ông tự cho mình là anh hùng thì không thể nào sa sút đến mức đi bưng bê, rửa bát được? Anh đã rút ra được cho mình kinh nghiệm rằng, muốn xin được việc phải có người giới thiệu, là Sài đại quan nhân chính là cứu cánh của Lâm Xung lúc này. Được Lý Tiểu Nhị giúp đỡ, Lâm Xung đã được vào thử việc tại Công ty Trách nhiệm Hữu hạn Lương Sơn do Vương Luân và hai người nữa là cổ đông cao nhất. Nhưng Lâm Xung là người quá tài cao vọng trọng, một người có trí tuệ, đừng cầm đầu 80 vạn cấm quân nên Vương Luân rất do dự khi nhận một người cấp dưới tài giỏi hơn mình. Vậy liệu chàng Lâm Xung có qua được cửa ải mà Vương Luân đặt ra để vào làm việc ở Công ty Lương Sơn không?\nRồi Võ Tòng trên đường vào kinh thành, tạt ghé ăn bát mì bò cũng nêu ra rất nhiều những vấn đề trong quản lý nhân tâm. Sau khi áp giải hàng đến kinh thành xong, Võ Tòng thấy bụng đói meo, phía trước có quán Mỳ nước Mạnh Châu. Mỳ nấu khá ngon nhưng Võ Tòng thắc mắc tại sao lại không có khách, nhìn xung quanh cũng chỉ có mình. Ông chủ cửa hàng cho hay, ngày xưa quán làm ăn cũng tốt, vị trí đẹp nhưng do không đề phòng lòng người nên đã bị mất dưới tay người thân cận. Cũng bởi là do cách trả lương quy trách nhiệm của ông chủ không rõ ràng, có nhiều kẽ hở khiến người dưới có thể lượn lẹo hòng chiếm lợi về mình. Và trong quá trình làm việc cùng nhau, ông chủ cửa hàng đã quên mất một điều rất quan trọng là phải xây dựng tình thân với cấp dưới, quan tâm đến họ để họ dốc tâm dốc trí phục vụ mình. Vì thiếu những điều cơ bản đó nên kết quả cuối cùng thì ai cũng đã rõ, quán của ông dường như không có nhân viên mà cũng chả có khách.\nRất nhiều, rất nhiều những câu chuyện xoay quanh cuộc đời của các nhân vật trong Thủy hử đã được Thành Quân Ức dùng bút pháp độc đáo có một không hai để khác họa quá trình trưởng thành của các anh hùng hảo hán theo Lương Sơn, làm nổi bật những qui tắc doanh nghiệp, nghệ thuật quản lý mà bạn không hề nghĩ đến trong tác phẩm kinh điển này. Và điều cuối cùng quan trọng nhất, bạn sẽ tìm thấy vị trí của chính mình trong cuốn sách.\n",

    "description": "Cuốn sách được Bill George viết ra cho một thế hệ lãnh đạo mới, tức là bao gồm từ những CEO vừa được bổ nhiệm cho đến những sinh viên đang muốn trở thành lãnh đạo trong tương lai, và tất cả những nhà lãnh đạo nằm ở giữa hai cực nói trên - những người đang phải chuẩn bị nhận thêm những trách nhiệm mới. Thông điệp của cuốn sách này nói thì dễ mà làm thì không dễ chút nào: chúng ta cần những nhà lãnh đạo đích thực (authentic leaders) để điều hành các tổ chức, những nhà lãnh đạo cam kết cao với việc quản lý các tài sản của tổ chức và việc tạo ra những khác biệt trong cuộc sống của những người mà họ phục vụ.\nVậy nhà lãnh đạo đích thực là gì? Theo Bill Geogre, khi các nhà lãnh đạo là những người phụng sự tận tụy, lãnh đạo một cách đích thực và chân thành, thì họ sẽ xây dựng được những tổ chức bền vững, những tổ chức tạo ra điều tốt và lợi ích cho con người, tạo ra sự khác biệt to lớn trên thế giới. Và có một cách tốt hơn để dẫn dắt công ty - cách thức xây dựng một tổ chức bền vững và làm lợi cho mọi chủ thể liên quan, khách hàng, người lao động và cổ đông. Điều đó không có nghĩa là nhà lãnh đạo đích thực sẽ không được tưởng thưởng cho những nỗ lực của mình. Ngược lại, phần thưởng của họ sẽ vượt xa hơn những phần thưởng tài chính thông thường, mà trở thành sự thỏa mãn khi tạo ra sự khác biệt trong cuộc sống của khách hàng, tạo ra cơ hội cho nhân viên, tạo ra lợi nhuận cao trong dài hạn cho các cổ đông. Đồng thời, nhà lãnh đạo đích thực cũng có một cuộc sống chính trực và cân bằng giữa gia đình và công việc. Chân dung nhà lãnh đạo đích thực được Bill George dựng lên khác nhiều so với hình ảnh những nhà lãnh đạo mà trước đây chúng ta từng biết: chỉ biết sống với công việc; và ông đã chứng minh kiểu lãnh đạo cũ đó không mang lại hiệu quả lâu dài.\nCuốn sách cũng bàn về quan hệ giữa nhà lãnh đạo và tổ chức mà họ dẫn dắt, qua đó thể hiện cách thức nhà lãnh đạo phát triển bản thân từ mối tương tác với tổ chức, từ đó tạo ra những công ty đích thực. Những tổ chức như vậy sẽ có tính cạnh tranh rất cao trên thị trường và sẽ phát triển bền vững.\nQua những minh họa, phân tích thực tế và sâu sắc từ các tập đoàn lớn trên thế giới đồng thời từ chính hành trình lãnh đạo của Bill George, đặc biệt là thời gian ông làm tại Medtronic - một trong những tập đoàn công nghệ y tế hàng đầu thế giới - người đọc được tiếp thu nhiều bài học quý giá về thuật lãnh đạo đích thực giúp phát triển vai trò lãnh đạo của cá nhân, cách thức để xây dựng một công ty phát triển bền vững, vượt qua những thách thức thường gặp trên thương trường. Có ý kiến cho rằng cuốn sách này xứng đáng là một Tuyên ngôn về Tinh thần và Giá trị của Thuật lãnh đạo, có thể giúp ích cho giới lãnh đạo nói chung, không chỉ với các nhà lãnh đạo kinh doanh mà còn với các nhà lãnh đạo thuộc mọi loại hình tổ chức khác.\n",

Hơn nữa, bộ máy quản lý cần phải cung cấp thông tin cho nhà đầu tư nhiều hơn, chứ không phải ít đi. Về tính không ổn định của thị trường, các nghiên cứu đã cho thấy những công ty không cung cấp thông tin định hướng thường dễ biến động hơn những công ty có cung cấp. Quan trọng hơn là những công ty không cung cấp thông tin định hướng thường có giá trị vốn hóa thị trường nhỏ hơn. Nói cách khác, những công ty đưa ra ước tính thu nhập thường có giá cổ phiếu cao hơn.\nVì thế, đây là một quyển sách khác thường. Tuy tập trung nói về nhà đầu tư thành công nhất trong lịch sử hiện đại, nhưng nó cũng mang lại cho độc giả những kiến thức sâu sắc và chiến lược chắc chắn để đầu tư. Và cuối cùng, những diễn giải của nó về thuế và sự minh bạch trong quản trị sẽ tạo ra một môi trường thuận lợi để giá trị vốn cổ phần mở rộng hơn nữa.\n",

Trong thế kỷ 21, liệu nền kinh tế Hàn Quốc có tiếp tục phát triển với tốc độ cao như trước đây không? Hơn 90% triệu phú trẻ tỏ thái độ hoài nghi. Trong thời đại lạm phát, tăng trưởng kinh tế thấp, cung vượt cầu, muốn thành công về kinh tế nhanh chóng thì không gì khác hơn là nhắm vào các thị trường có sức hấp dẫn đầu tư lớn. Đó là chiến lược làm giàu rõ nét nhất của các triệu phú trẻ Hàn Quốc.\nĐể thực hiện điều đó, giới triệu phú trẻ đều có chung một ý kiến: họ phải lập kế hoạch đa dạng về thị trường đầu tư và mặt hàng đầu tư như cổ phiếu, trái phiếu, ngoại hối đầu tư ra nước ngoài... dựa trên nền tảng là thị trường bất động sản truyền thống. Khác với tầm nhìn và chiến lược của các triệu phú thời trước, những người đã phải tiết kiệm từng đồng suốt hàng chục năm ròng; rõ ràng Hàn Quốc ngày nay nổi lên lớp triệu phú trẻ mới với tư duy đột phá.\nQuyển sách này giới thiệu đến các bạn một số trường hợp thành công điển hình trong đầu tư làm giàu của những người trẻ Hàn Quốc.

    "description": "ĐÁNH GIÁ TỪ TIKI.VN:\nLấy những nhân vật đã quen thuộc với độc giả trong Tam Quốc Chí như Lưu Bị, Tào Tháo, Tôn Quyền,... đặt vào thế giới hiện đại và biến mỗi quốc gia thành một công ty, Thành Quân Ức đã tạo nên một câu chuyện ấn tượng của riêng mình. Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa là một quyển sách kinh tế hay về quản trị dành cho người mới bắt đầu. Một số câu chuyện trong đó có thể nói là \"thánh kinh\" dành cho người khởi nghiệp.\nĐọc sách, không khó để độc giả nhận ra những nhân vật huyền thoại của La Quán Trung đều được giữ nguyên những nét tính cách đặc trưng của mình. Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa có những tình huống kinh doanh cụ thể \"mượn xưa nói nay\" và được so sánh với những nguyên tắc quản trị của phương Tây. Kết thúc mỗi chương, những bài học rút ra khiến bạn đọc nhớ và nghiền ngẫm.\nCách viết hài hước và lôi cuốn của Thành Quân Ức giúp cuốn sách gần gũi với độc giả hơn. Thay vì lý giải bằng những lý thuyết khô khan của kinh tế học, tác giả đã chọn cách tiếp cận khá vui nhộn và thực tiễn. Nhờ thế mà Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa giống như một cuốn tiểu thuyết giải thích cuộc đời và phương châm quản lý dưới góc độ lịch sử.\n©\nXuất bản lần đầu năm 2003, Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa ngay lập tức trở thành một quyển sách kinh tế bán chạy ở cả trong và ngoài Trung Quốc. Nó trở thành truyền kỳ trong số các tác phẩm viết về quản lý học bởi số lượng bán ra khiến người ta phải trầm trồ thán phục, và trong một khoảng thời gian đã tạo nên “hiện tượng nóng bỏng” với khoảng hơn trăm loạt sách ăn theo. Cách viết giải thích cuộc đời và phương châm quản lý dưới góc độ lịch sử cũng tạo nên ảnh hưởng kiểu bắc cầu với những tiểu thuyết thương trường, tiểu thuyết quan chức và các tác phẩm lấy đề tài lịch sử sau này.\nNội dung của Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa là những câu chuyện trong Tam quốc diễn nghĩa của La Quán Trung được “chuyển dịch” sang môi trường kinh doanh hiện đại. Thế vạc ba nước Hán -Thục - Ngô thời Tam quốc biến thành ba loại hình công ty hiện đại: một là công ty lớn, sẵn có thực lực hùng mạnh, được hưởng nhiều ưu đãi nhưng ẩn chứa nhiều bất ổn bên trong (Công ty nhà nước Đông Hán của Tào Tháo), hai là công ty dựa vào bản sắc riêng mà giữ vững thị phần, đợi thời cơ là khuếch trương (Tập đoàn Đông Ngô của Tôn Quyền), và ba là công ty từ tay trắng mà nên (Công ty Hoàng Tộc của Lưu Bị). Bằng lối văn hài hước và vô cùng sống động, tác giả Thành Quân Ức đưa người đọc theo bước chân của Lưu Bị từ khi là cậu học trò nghèo cho tới khi làm tổng giám đốc, gặp được nhà tư vấn Gia Cát Lượng và lập nên tập đoàn Thục Hán, chia ba thị trường Trung Quốc.\nCũng trong cuốn sách này, người đọc còn gặp Đổng Trác, Lã Bố trong vai các giám đốc giảo hoạt, Viên Thiệu lãnh đạo công ty tư nhân nhưng phong cách quản lý đặc sệt “hành chính bao cấp”, tổng giám đốc điều hành Tào Tháo quyền mưu đã biến cả một tổng công ty nhà nước thành của riêng…\nVề cuốn sách của mình, tác giả Thành Quân Ức viết: “Trong mắt tôi, dù lịch sử của quốc gia, lịch sử dân tộc hay lịch sử doanh nghiệp đều là những ví dụ cho quản lý học. Cái gọi là lấy lịch sử làm ví dụ thực chất là nghiên cứu và học hỏi từ lịch sử… Cách nhìn quản lý dưới góc độ lịch sử và kể lịch sử thông qua quản lý là một đặc điểm học thuật rất thú vị.”\nSau khi xuất bản Tam Quốc @ Diễn Nghĩa (hay còn gọi là Tam Quốc Thời A Còng) nhanh chóng trở thành cuốn sách kinh doanh bán chạy nhất Trung Quốc vào năm 2003, 2004.\nMời các bạn đón đọc!\n",

    "description": "Kể từ khi hệ thống Ngân hàng thương mại đi vào hoạt động đến nay, thu nhập của hầu hết các Ngân hàng là từ hoạt động động cấp tín dụng. Tuy nhiên, trong những năm gần đây, nền kinh tế của hầu hết các nước đều gặp khó khăn, các doanh nghiệp ngày càng e dè trong việc vay mượn. Từ đó, tạo ra nhiều khó khăn cho hoạt động của Ngân hàng nói chung và hoạt động cấp tín dụng nói riêng. Do đó, các Ngân hàng đang loay hoay với việc tìm kiếm thu nhập từ các kênh kinh doanh hay dịch vụ mới, như: thu phí dịch vụ, bán chéo sản phẩm, thanh toán quốc tế, kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ,...\nVề các mảng sản phẩm, dịch vụ truyền thống khác thì sự cạnh tranh rất khốc liệt và gần giống nhau. Trong sự khó khăn đó, kinh doanh ngoại hối (đơn giản là kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ) trở nên là một kênh kinh doanh có sự cạnh tranh ít hơn, có khả năng tạo ra lợi nhuận nhiều hơn so với các hoạt động kinh doanh khác và có khả năng quản lý được rủi ro.  Tuy nhiên, một loạt các câu hỏi được đặt ra cho hoạt động kinh doanh này như sau:\n1) Hoạt động kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ của các Ngân hàng và Doanh nghiệp đã và đang diễn ra như thế nào?\n2) Hoạt động này đang gặp những rủi ro nào? Các Ngân hàng và Doanh nghiệp đang quản lý rủi ro hoạt động kinh doanh này ra sao?\n3) Có câu nói cho rằng: “Lợi nhuận cao thì rủi ro cũng cao”, vậy có cách nào “Lợi nhuận cao mà rủi ro lại thấp hoặc trong tầm kiểm soát được trong hoạt động kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ\" của các Ngân hàng và Doanh nghiệp hay không?\n4) Có giải pháp nào để các Ngân hàng/Doanh nghiệp quản lý được rủi ro trong hoạt động kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ?\n5) Giải pháp nào cho các cơ quan chức năng hoàn thiện việc quản lý thị trường vàng, ngoại tệ và tạo thuận lợi cho sự phát triển của hoạt động kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ sắp đến? Tất cả các câu hỏi trên sẽ được giải đáp trong cuốn sách “Quản lý rủi ro trong kinh doanh ngoại hối tại các Ngân hàng thương mại cổ phần”.\nÝ kiến của một số độc giả\nĐây là 1 quyển sách rất hay viết về chủ đề kinh doanh ngoại hối và quản lý rủi ro trong kinh doanh ngoại hối tại các NHTM mà tôi chưa thấy có quyển sách nào trên thị trường phân tích sâu sắc và rất nhiều thông tin như quyển sách này.\n(Tiến Sĩ Khoa Học Nguyễn Ngọc Thạch - Quyền Viện trưởng Viện nghiên cứu và khoa học công nghệ, Trường Đại học Ngân hàng TP.HCM)\nTác giả quyển sách đã đề cập đến hầu hết các góc cạnh của chuyên đề này một cách rất sâu sắc. Theo tôi biết, các tác giả đã bỏ ra gần 4 năm để nghiên cứu về chủ đề này và đề tài này đã qua nhiều lần phản biện, chỉnh sửa. Đây là quyển sách rất đáng đọc và phù hợp với nhiều đối tượng khác nhau, như: các nhà hoạch định chính sách, NHNN, các NHTM, các nhà khoa học, nhà nghiên cứu và các sinh viên chuyên ngành kinh tế.\n(NGND.PGS.TS Ngô Hướng - Nguyên Hiệu trưởng, Trường Đại học Ngân hàng TP.HCM)\nĐây là 1 chủ đề rất hay và phù hợp với hầu hết các ngân hàng, cũng như các doanh nghiệp đang hoạt động tại Việt nam. Trong phần nội dung, tôi đã đọc qua toàn bộ quyển sách, tôi nhận thấy tác giả phân tích rất sâu sắc về thực trạng của các NHTM, doanh nghiệp trong hoạt động kinh doanh vàng và ngoại tệ; cũng như nhóm tác giả đã đưa ra được các giải pháp/kiến nghị đến các NHTM, doanh nghiệp, các cơ quan chức năng tại Việt nam nhằm ngày càng hoàn thiện và tăng thu nhập cho ngân hàng, cũng như tạo điều kiện cho sự phát triển lành mạnh của thị trường vàng và ngoại tệ trong thời gian sắp tới.\n(Phan Bích Vân - Tổng giám đốc JPMorgan Chase Việt Nam)\nTheo tôi đây là quyển sách hay và phù hợp cho các nhà kinh doanh về lĩnh vực vàng và ngoại tệ để nghiên cứu và áp dụng.\n(Nguyễn Đức Thuận - Giám đốc chi nhánh Điện Biên Phủ, Ngân hàng Sacombank)\n",

Trong một buổi tiệc, bạn có thể sẽ nói về một bộ phim hay về một đồng nghiệp. Bạn có thể trao đổi các câu chuyện về việc đi du lịch, nhắc đến con của một ai đó, hoặc phàn nàn về thời tiết đột nhiên ấm bất thường.\nTại sao? Bạn có thể nói về bất cứ thứ gì. Có cả tỉ chủ đề, ý tưởng, sản  phẩm và câu chuyện khác nhau để bạn bàn tán. Tại sao bạn lại nói về những thứ nhất định đó? Tại sao lại là câu chuyện, bộ phim hay đồng nghiệp đó mà không phải là câu chuyện khác, bộ phim khác hay đồng  nghiệp khác? Một số câu chuyện có tính lan truyền nhiều hơn, một số tin  đồn có khả năng lây lan cao hơn. Một số nội dung trực tuyến trở nên phổ biến, trong khi một số khác không bao giờ được lan truyền. Một số sản phẩm được truyền khẩu rất nhiều, trong khi một số khác không được nhắc đến. Tại sao? Điều gì khiến cho một số sản phẩm, ý tưởng và hành động  được nói đến nhiều hơn?\nTất cả những điều đó sẽ được giải thích trong Hiệu ứng lan truyền. Ngoài ra cuốn sách này sẽ làm sáng tỏ những quy trình tâm lý và xã hội học đằng sau khoa học của sự lan truyền xã hội qua sáu nguyên lý bao gồm:\nSự Công nhận Xã hội, Sự Kích hoạt, Cảm xúc, Công khai, Giá trị Thực tế và Những câu chuyện. Đồng thời, thông qua việc giải thích các hiện tượng lan truyền trong xã hội, tác giả cũng đưa ra cách thức kết cấu nên những câu chuyện, thông điệp, quảng cáo và thông tin để mọi người phải chia sẻ chúng cho dù đó có nhiều bạn bè hay không.\nDù là giám đốc một công ty lớn, hay chủ một công ty nhỏ đang cố gắng nâng cao nhận thức về công ty mình, một chính trị gia vận động bầu cử hoặc một quan chức y tế đang cố gắng thúc đẩy một thông điệp, thì cuốn sách này sẽ giúp bạn hiểu cách làm cho sản phẩm và ý tưởng trở nên lan truyền - cách cấu thành những câu chuyện, thông điệp, quảng cáo và thông tin để mọi người chia sẻ chúng rộng rãi.\n",

    "description": "Cuốn sách được tác giả ưu ái dành tặng \"Steve Jobs cùng tất cả những người sáng tạo trong cuộc đời tôi\".\nNgay ở chương đầu tiên, tác giả đã viết:\n“Một trong những ý tưởng mà tôi và Steve đã đề cập đến đó là quan niệm về nguyên tắc. Chúng tôi cho rằng sự sáng tạo không thể có được khi có những nguyên tắc quá chặt chẽ. Vì thế, cuốn sách các bạn đang cầm trên tay sẽ không có nguyên tắc. Thay vào đó, chỉ có những “pong” mà thôi.\nMột “pong” là một lời khuyên (trong cuốn sách này, đó là lời khuyên giúp phát triển trí óc sáng tạo). Nó ứng dụng ở những nơi lời khuyên là hữu ích hoặc cần thiết, không giống một quy tắc, thường sẽ được hiểu là có thể áp dụng được trong mọi tình huống vậy. Sự thật là sẽ chẳng có qui tắc nào có thể áp dụng cho tất cả mọi người theo cách giống nhau, và sự thật này chính là ngoại lệ duy nhất cho qui tắc: không có qui tắc nào cả. Vì thế, trong cuốn sách này bạn sẽ tìm thấy năm mươi mốt “pong” - lời khuyên sẽ giúp bạn và công ty bạn thiết kế và tạo ra môi trường làm việc kích thích sức sáng tạo của con người.\nTại sao lại là sức sáng tạo?\nBởi vì giống như những gì tôi và Steve nói với nhau ở Paris, không có công ty nào có thể phát triển mạnh mẽ nếu thiếu sức sáng tạo. Điều này có vẻ không có gì là mới, nhưng bạn sẽ ngạc nhiên khi thấy rằng chỉ có rất ít các công ty trên thực tế áp dụng điều này. Sức sáng tạo giống như một người vận hành cho cả công ty vậy. Nó là điểm khởi đầu của mọi thứ, nơi năng lượng và sự chuyển động về phía trước hình thành. Nếu không có cú huých sáng tạo đầu tiên, sẽ không có thành quả gì hết. Đương nhiên, có một số ngành công nghiệp ý thức được về nhu cầu này hơn các ngành khác. Điện ảnh Hollywood, ngành công nghiệp game, ngành xuất bản - đều cần phải đi trước thị trường. Pong của Atari là một trò chơi điện tử đột phá và thành công, nhưng sau khi người ta chơi nó mười ngàn lần thì họ cũng sẽ chán và tìm kiếm một trò chơi khác. Chiến tranh giữa các vì sao (Star Wars) là một bộ phim tuyệt hay, nhưng khi bạn đã xem nó (có khi xem tới mười ngàn lần rồi) thì bạn sẽ cảm thấy sẵn sàng cho một trải nghiệm khác. Ở các ngành công nghiệp giải trí, sức sáng tạo không chỉ quan trọng mà còn là yếu tố thiết yếu.\nTrong các lĩnh vực khác nhau, có lẽ đều cần sự sáng tạo như nhau. Chỉ là điều này chưa được nhận ra mà thôi...\"\nPHẦN 1: TÌM KIẾM VÀ TUYỂN DỤNG STEVE JOBS KẾ TIẾP\n1: Dùng Nơi Làm Việc Như Một Tấm Biển Quảng Cáo\n2: Sử Dụng Pong Một Cách Linh Hoạt\n3: Hãy Biết Cách Quảng Cáo Sáng Tạo\n4: Tuyển dụng những cá nhân có long Đam Mê và Cường Độ Làm Việc Cao\n5: Quên Đi Chuyện Bằng Cấp\n6: Tìm Sở Thích\n7: Sử Dụng Nhân Viên Như Tài Nguyên\n8: Tránh Tuyển Những Bản Sao\n9: Đón Nhận Những Tên Đáng Ghét\n10: Đón Nhận Những Kẻ Điên\n11: Tìm Những người Bị Bắt Nạt\n12: Tìm Những “Kẻ Rình Rập”\n13: Hãy Hỏi Về Sách\n14: Chèo Thuyền\n15: Hãy Tuyển dụng Ngay Trước Mắt Bạn\n16: Tìm Qua Những Bài Tweet\n17: Đến Thăm Những Cộng Đồng Sáng Tạo\n18: Cẩn Thận Với Những Kẻ Khôn Lỏi\n19: Hỏi Những Câu Hỏi Kì Quặc\n20: Phỏng Vấn Sâu\nPhần 2:  GIỮ CHÂN VÀ ĐÀO TẠO NHỮNG STEVE JOBS KẾ THỪA\n21: Ăn Mừng\n22: Thiết Lập Một Chút hỗn loạn\n23: Khuyến Khích Nghịch Ngợm\n24: Thiết Lập Nhóm Độc Lập\n25: Nuôi Dưỡng Sự Công Bằng\n26: Cô Lập\n27: Chiến Thắng Dù Ý Tưởng Tệ\n28: Ăn Mừng Thất Bại\n29: Yêu Cầu Mạo Hiểm\n30: Hãy Thưởng Những Chú Gà Tây\n31: Người Hướng Dẫn\n32: Đối Xử Với Nhân Viên Một Cách Đàng Hoàng\n33: Tạo Ra Dây Chuyền Sáng Tạo\n34: Tạo Ra Không Gian Sáng Tạo\n35: Đặt Ra Ngày Thử Nghiệm\n36: Khuyến Khích ADHD\n37: Nghiên cứu trước thông tin\n38: Học cách nói chuyện với nhân viên sáng tạo\n39: Nghĩ Về Các Món Đồ Chơi\n40: Vô Hiệu Hóa Những Kẻ Nói Không\n41: Ghi Lại Những Phản Biện\n42: Những Nơi Sáng Tạo\n43: Sản Phẩm Chỉ Dành Cho Người Giàu\n44: Thay Đổi Hàng Ngày, Hàng Giờ45: Lăn Xúc Xắc\n46: Giảm bớt Quy Trình\n47: Đi Dạo Ngẫu Nhiên Trên Wikipedia\n48: Đừng Dựa dẫm Vào Kế Toán\n49: Tạo Ra Những Ngày Nghỉ Ngẫu Nhiên\n50: Kết hợp\n51: Đi Ngủ\n52: Kết Luận\n",

    "description": "Cho và nhận là cả một nghệ thuật. Khi cho đi một, bạn sẽ nhận về gấp nhiều lần (Mark Twain)\nThành công là điều mà tất cả chúng ta đều mong muốn. Có rất nhiều cách để thành công và mỗi người có một cách cho riêng mình. Sách về bí quyết thành công có rất nhiều nhưng hầu hết các bí quyết ấy lại không có một bí quyết rất đặc biệt: Cho đi. Ít ai đồng ý và nhận ra rằng ta sẽ thành công khi biết cho đi, biết giúp đỡ người khác cùng thành công, khi ấy ta thành công hơn cả thành công. Nhưng thường, ta chỉ thấy rằng những người giúp đỡ người khác thường chịu thiệt thòi, chẳng những không được đáp lại mà còn nhận nhiều sự phiền hà về bản thân mình.\nCho khế nhận vàng sẽ giúp bạn có cái nhìn khác đi về cho và nhận, nhất là trong lĩnh vực kinh doanh, một lĩnh vực mà khái niệm “Cho” chưa được thừa nhận như là một cách để thành công. Cho khế nhận vàng là quyển sách đặc biệt của Adam Grant. Từ thực tiễn giảng dạy của mình, Adam Grant - khi ấy đang là giáo sư trẻ nhất của ngôi trường Wharton danh giá - đã kiểm chứng nguyên nhân mang lại thành công cũng như dẫn đến thất bại của mỗi người. Anh đã phân chia ra ba nhóm người chính dựa theo phong cách hành xử: những người chỉ biết đến lợi ích bản thân, những người luôn hết lòng vì người khác và những người dung hòa. Trong khi những người chỉ biết lợi ích bản thân ra sức giành lấy phần có lợi nhất về mình, những người dung hòa hướng đến việc trao đổi lợi ích, thì những người luôn hết lòng vì người khác lại hoàn toàn khác biệt - họ luôn cố gắng giúp đỡ mọi người mà không cần bất cứ sự đền đáp nào. Đây cũng chính là chìa khóa mang lại thành công cho họ - những người luôn hết mình vì người khác. Được giới chuyên môn, bao gồm cả những tên tuổi như Dan Pink, Tony Hsieh, Dan Ariely, Susan Cain, Robert Cialdini,… cũng như đội ngũ lãnh đạo của những tập đoàn lừng danh như Google, McKinsey, Merck, Estée Lauder, Nike, và cả NASA đánh giá cao. Cho khế nhận vàng thực sự là một cuốn cẩm nang dạy ta cách thức làm việc, hành xử sao cho đạt hiệu quả cao nhất, với hiệu quả không giới hạn cho một cá nhân nào, mà bao phủ lên thành công của tổ chức cũng như cộng đồng.\nPhần đầu tiên của quyển sách sẽ chỉ ra những nguyên tắc mang lại thành công cho những người vì mọi người, qua đó lý giải tại sao và làm thế nào mà họ đạt đến nấc thang thành công cao nhất. Tác giả cũng sẽ giới thiệu với bạn các phương pháp độc đáo của những con người này khi kết hợp bốn yếu tố chính: mạng lưới quan hệ, sự hợp tác, cách xác định giá trị và lan tỏa ảnh hưởng.Trong phần thứ hai của cuốn sách, là những phân tích được và mất khi bạn lựa chọn cách hành xử vì người khác, và cách thức giữ cho cán cân này thăng bằng. Bạn sẽ thấy trường hợp một giáo viên giảm thiểu những áp lực cho mình bằng cách cho đi thay vì giữ lại, một tỷ phú làm giàu bằng cách ban phát tiền bạc và số giờ lý tưởng để tham gia hoạt động tình nguyện nếu bạn muốn sống vui và sống khỏe hơn. Bạn sẽ biết được nguyên nhân tại sao việc cho đi lại đem đến thành công cho nhà tư vấn này trong khi khiến nhà tư vấn khác thất bại, tại sao chúng ta lại nhận diện nhầm một người thuộc nhóm chỉ muốn nhận hay dung hòa, cũng như cách thức những người chỉ biết mình bảo vệ bản thân trong các cuộc trao đổi, đàm phán,...\nTrong cuốn sách này, tác giả muốn chứng minh cho các bạn thấy rằng chúng ta đã đánh giá thấp khả năng thành công của những người tử tế như David Hornik - những người sẵn sàng cho. Tuy thường bị mỉa mai là những kẻ ngốc nghếch và vô dụng, những người này hóa ra lại thành công nhất. Nhằm tìm ra căn nguyên thành công của họ, tác giả đã khảo chứng một số câu chuyện và trường hợp tiêu biểu để hiểu bằng cách nào mà việc cho đi lại có hiệu quả và không rủi ro như suy nghĩ của chúng ta. Xuyên suốt nội dung, bạn đọc sẽ được biết những trường hợp thành công đến từ mọi thành phần trong xã hội, bao gồm: các chuyên viên cố vấn, bác sĩ, luật sư, kỹ sư, nhân viên bán hàng, giáo viên, kế toán viên, nhà văn và vận động viên thể thao. Điểm chung là họ đều theo đuổi ý tưởng tạo dựng thành công cho bản thân trước, rồi sau đó quay lại giúp đỡ những người khác, qua đó chứng minh rằng những người biết cho đi trước chắc chắn là những người nằm ở vị trí thuận lợi nhất để nhận lấy thành công sau này.\nNhận định\n“Với những bằng chứng xác thực, Adam Grant là người đầu tiên chỉ ra những động cơ dẫn đến sự thay đổi nơi các mối quan hệ trong thời đại ngày nay. Ở tác phẩm này, anh đã chỉ ra sợi dây gắn kết các mối quan hệ xã hội và nguồn gốc thành công nằm ở chính việc mang lại thành công cho những người xung quanh. Có thể nói, đây là một trong những cuốn sách hiếm hoi có giá trị thực tiễn cao. Nó quả thật là cuốn cẩm nang bạn nên đọc mỗi ngày.”- Paul Saffo, giám đốc điều hành của Foresight, ủy viên Diễn đàn Kinh tế Thế giới\nCho khế nhận vàng chứa đựng đầy chất liệu cuộc sống, những câu chuyện và trải nghiệm có thể khiến ta thay đổi tận gốc quan điểm của mình. Nổi bật và sắc sảo, đây không chỉ đơn thuần là một cuốn sách mà còn là cả một thế giới quan mới mẻ và rực rỡ.” - Susan Cain, tác giả cuốn sách Quiet\n",

Kiểu dáng chữ in đặc biệt của Coca-Cola và màu đỏ đầy sức sống rất dễ nhớ và không thể nhầm lẫn; lô-gô của IBM - với màu xanh riêng biệt - có thể được nhận biết trên khắp thế giới; lô gô hình ngôi sao ba cạnh được bao tròn của Mercedes không chỉ được coi là sự đảm bảo của kĩ thuật siêu việt, mà còn là biểu tượng giá trị chất lượng cao của các dòng xe hơi, dễ dàng truyền tải dấu hiệu của thị hiếu tốt và địa vị của chủ xe. Các lô gô có đặc tính mạnh giống như các chương trình quảng cáo và quan hệ công chúng này trở nên hiệu quả hơn khi trở thành phép tốc ký bằng hình ảnh dành cho các ý nghĩa đi kèm và do đó, gây ảnh hưởng đến người tiêu dùng, để họ dễ dàng lĩnh hội thông điệp của công ty.\nCác sản phẩm có lô gô của các công ty nổi tiếng, chất lượng cao, hưởng lợi nhờ quan điểm rằng chúng cũng có chất lượng siêu việt. Do đó, sự hấp dẫn của sản phẩm đối với người tiêu dùng được nâng lên nhờ mức độ dễ chịu được gợi nên từ thương hiệu mà người tiêu dùng đã quen thuộc. Lô gô có thể rất dễ nhớ và kết tinh nhiều ý nghĩa. Bản thân lô gô không nhất thiết phải là công cụ giao tiếp, nhưng chắc chắn, nó là biểu tượng cho thứ mà công ty thể hiện (hoặc mong muốn thể hiện) và sự nhận thức của người tiêu dùng khi nhìn thấy lô gô đó.\nVới tư cách là lá cờ đầu của công ty, lô gô là tài sản hình ảnh quan trọng nhất, và cũng là chất xúc tác tạo cảm nhận tốt đẹp hoặc tồi tệ, do đó cần được quản lý với sự cẩn trọng khôn ngoan. Ngày nay, sự cẩn trọng khôn ngoan nghĩa là trở nên linh hoạt hơn và có ảnh hưởng sâu rộng hơn. Các bộ nhận diện thương hiệu trong nền kinh tế mới ngày càng sống động hơn và hiệu quả hơn, nếu hệ thống nhận diện này tích hợp các yếu tố như tính nhạy bén về xã hội, phù hợp với văn hóa và nỗ lực tìm kiếm sự kết nối đích thực với con người.\nCần có các giải pháp sáng tạo để tìm ra “yếu tố con người” kết hợp và cốt yếu này. Lô gô có thể hữu hình, nhưng nếu không được nhân tính hóa - tức là nếu thiếu đi “trái tim” - nó sẽ giống với một con người không có “trái tim”: lạnh lùng, thờ ơ, tức là một người máy.\"\n",

    "description": "Quản lý rủi ro có hiệu quả đã trở nên một chủ đề chính được đưa ra thảo luận trong những cuộc họp của hội đồng quản trị. Các công ty nhận thức rằng trong khi sự liêm chính về quản lý tài chính và tính liên tục trong kinh doanh vẫn mang tầm quan trọng cơ bản, những chủ đề này phải được xem xét song song với các rủi ro trong thực tế kinh doanh, chẳng hạn như uy tín và thương hiệu, tuyển dụng, tính khả tín của sản phẩm, sức khỏe và an toàn, tài sản trí tuệ, và chuỗi cung ứng. Các sự cố trong bất kỳ lĩnh vực nào cũng có thể hủy hoại triển vọng tạo ra giá trị và thành công trong kinh doanh.\nĐể quản lý rủi ro kinh doanh - và đặc biệt là trong môi trường nhiều thách thức - bắt buộc hội đồng quản trị của công ty phải được cấu trúc để thiết lập sự kiểm soát nghiêm ngặt đối với rủi ro và thực hiện báo cáo minh bạch cho các cổ đông. Việc tuân thủ một cách thụ động những luật lệ và qui định không còn là một chọn lựa đúng đắn. Cuốn sách hướng dẫn thực tế về những lĩnh vực rủi ro tiềm năng này chứa đựng lời khuyên quý báu cho các giám đốc của mọi công ty, lớn và nhỏ, cung cấp những ý tưởng căn bản cho việc quản lý rủi ro một cách tổng quát và dễ hiểu.\n",

    "description": "“Cuộc Cách Mạng Một - Cọng - Rơm” là cuốn sách nổi tiếng của Mansanobu Fukuoka, người khai sinh nông nghiệp tự nhiên của Nhật Bản và thế giới. Cuốn sách (đã được dịch ra 25 thứ tiếng) không chỉ là sự trải nghiệm về cách thức nuôi trồng các sản phẩm nông nghiệp trong sự tương tác hài hòa với môi trường tự nhiên mà còn đem đến cho người đọc những suy tưởng thú vị về triết học, về ăn uống, về y học và cuộc sống.\nCó thể gọi ông Masanobu Fukuoka, tác giả cuốn sách, là người nông dân vĩ đại nhất hành tinh cũng không có gì là lạm dụng từ ngữ. Ông là người đạt đến cảnh giới vô vi trong nông nghiệp và là vị sư tổ của nông nghiệp tự nhiên.\nNhưng bạn không nên để tựa đề cuốn sách đánh lừa. “Cuộc cách mạng một - cọng - rơm”, nhưng chẳng có “cuộc cách mạng” nào ở đây cả. Cuốn sách chỉ là những ghi chép của một người làm nông khiêm nhường rón rén trước thiên nhiên vườn ruộng, như thể mỗi một từ được viết ra tác giả đều sợ làm tổn thương đất đai cây cỏ.\nBạn cũng sẽ thất vọng nếu có ý định tìm trong cuốn sách này những tri thức về nông nghiệp, dù là nông nghiệp hữu cơ hay nông nghiệp tự nhiên. Bởi vì đối với ông Fukuoka, tri thức là hữu hạn, còn thiên nhiên cây cối là vô cùng, cái hữu hạn không thể thâu tóm được cái vô cùng.\nCuốn sách cũng không nhằm góp phần làm đa dạng hóa kiến thức của bạn về thiên nhiên và cuộc sống. Bạn sẽ thấy tác giả của nó không hề có ý định như vậy.\nTrong kho tàng sách vở của nhân loại, trừ cuốn Pháp bảo đàn kinh của Lục tổ thiền tông Huệ Năng, hiếm có cuốn sách nào như cuốn sách này, khi mà tác giả không hướng người đọc theo tư tưởng và quan niệm của người viết sách mà hướng người đọc vào chính bản thân họ trong mối quan hệ tương tác với môi trường sinh ra và nuôi dưỡng họ.\nViết về nông nghiệp nhưng ông Fukuoka không để người đọc dính mắc vào các kiến thức trồng trọt và chăn nuôi, cũng không dính mắc vào chính cuốn sách của ông. Người ta bảo phương pháp Fukuoka là thiền trong nông nghiệp là vì vậy.\nĐọc cuốn sách này và gấp nó lại, bạn sẽ không còn nghĩ ông Fukuoka đã viết những gì, nhưng bạn sẽ nhận ra vô số những điều mà trước đây do những tri thức học ở sách vở, trong trường lớp đã biến thành định kiến trong đầu bạn khiến cho bạn không nhận ra. Bạn sẽ nhìn cái cây không phải là giống thực vật vô tri được mô tả trong sách trồng trọt mà là cái cây có tâm hồn. Bạn sẽ thú vị nhớ lại, trong câu chuyện cổ tích Một người mẹ, nhà văn Andersen đã từng bảo mỗi một cái cây đều có một số phận, mỗi cái cây đều có một trái tim. Và bạn sẽ hiểu vì sao ông Fukuoka lại nói chỉ có những đứa trẻ mới nhìn được thiên nhiên như thiên nhiên vốn có.\n \n",

Trong nhiều bài viết như Người Việt có quan tâm đến \"giáo dục thật\" hay Gửi Bộ trưởng: Một lá thư ngỏ bàn về giáo dục…, tác giả đã đưa ra những phân tích, đánh giá thấu đáo khi dựa trên những số liệu, tư liệu mang tính đối chiếu, so sánh giữa giáo dục Việt Nam với nền giáo dục các quốc gia tiên tiến trên thế giới: Mỹ, Anh, Singapore…\nViết về các vấn đề xã hội, tác giả đã khai thác nhiều đề tài cũ bằng góc nhìn mới. Là một chuyên gia trong lĩnh vực hàng không, nhưng tác giả luôn đau đáu với những vấn đề liên quan đến sự phát triển hay những mặt còn tồn tại trong đời sống văn hóa của đất nước. Từ văn hóa xếp hàng tới tư duy mạng nhện, từ văn hóa khi tham gia giao thông tới việc quảng bá du lịch nước nhà đều được tác giả dựa trên những quan sát, trải nghiệm, so sánh giữa Việt Nam với các nước trong khu vực và trên thế giới...\nNhận định\n\"Đọc cuốn sách này, sẽ thấy một Lương Hoài Nam -  nhà báo chuyên nghiệp.\nMột trong các phẩm chất của nhà báo chuyên nghiệp là không từ chối các đề tài, một khi nó đến từ cuộc sống. Không phải nhà báo chọn đề tài, mà cuộc sống “bắt” nhà báo phải viết về cái gì. Mức độ phong phú của các lĩnh vực đề tài tác giả viết khiến bất cứ nhà báo chuyên nghiệp nào cũng có thể phải ghen tỵ: đường sắt, hàng không, xe máy, an toàn giao thông, nợ xấu, thương hiệu, mạng nhện dây diện, thị trường bất động sản, công nghiệp ô tô ở Việt Nam, và nhiều nhất là giáo dục.\"\n(Nhà báo Trần Đăng Tuấn, Tổng giám đốc Đài truyền hình An Viên)\n\"Trong câu chuyện giáo dục, câu hỏi anh (hay tôi) thuộc về lũy tre làng hay thuộc về biển lớn thực ra không quan trọng lắm. Câu hỏi quan trọng là anh có muốn con anh sống với thế giới rộng lớn hơn thế giới của chính bản thân anh hay không? Nếu chúng ta đã thực sự rành mạch với bản thân mình rồi thì câu hỏi chọn mô hình nào cho giáo dục Việt Nam sẽ không cần phải bàn cãi nhiều nữa\".\n(GS. Ngô Bảo Châu)\n",

Ông đề cao tư tưởng pháp trị, định ra luật lệ, quy chế hành chính và gương mẫu thực hiện.\nTrần Thủ Độ xứng đáng được xếp vào hàng những nhân vật kiệt xuất, đi đầu trong sự nghiệp dựng nước và giữ nước trong lịch sử dân tộc.\n",

    "description": "Vốn kiến thức trong ngành Y và những năm tháng rong ruổi khắp châu Âu, châu Á và Bắc Phi đã giúp Gustave Le Bon theo đuổi ý tưởng về sự bình đẳng giữa các cá nhân và dân tộc. Ông cho rằng \"Con người dễ thuyết phục bản thân rằng bất bình đẳng chỉ đơn thuần là kết quả của sự khác biệt giáo dục, rằng con người sinh ra đều tốt và thông minh, rằng trách nhiệm duy nhất cho những lời nói dối xuyên tạc chính là thể chế mà họ đang sống\". Le Bon có có thể sẽ vấp phải sự phản đối mạnh mẽ khi quyển sách này chỉ ra những sai lầm của lối tư duy đó bằng cách đánh giá, xem xét các nền văn minh, nghệ thuật, thể chế và tín ngưỡng. Ông cũng thừa nhận các tổ chức thể chế có quyền lực kiểm soát vận mệnh của con người, nhưng với ông, tầm quan trọng của nó rất ít đối với sự phát triển của một nền văn minh. Theo ông, \"Một trong những sai lầm to lớn của thời hiện đại là tin rằng tâm hồn con người chỉ tìm được hạnh phúc trong những sự vật bên ngoài. Hạnh phúc là ở trong chúng ta, do chính chúng ta tạo ra, và hầu như chẳng khi nào ở bên ngoài chúng ta.\"…\nChắc chắn nhiều người đọc Le Bon sẽ bất bình với quan điểm và tư tưởng, đánh giá của ông về các dân tộc, về đám đông (mù quáng, lầm lạc, a dua, quá khích, thụ động...) và chính ông cũng bị chỉ trích, tranh cãi từ khi ông công bố các quan điểm này vào cuối thế kỷ 19. Ngay những trang đầu tiên của Tâm lý dân tộc, ông đã chỉ trích/phản đối quan điểm về bình đẳng. Le Bon chỉ trích tư tưởng bình đẳng ngay trong những dòng đầu tiên ông viết..., thậm chí nói sự bình đẳng cản trở và kím hãm sự tiến hóa của con người. Cuốn sách Những quy luật tâm lý về sự tiến hóa của các dân tộc, hay đúng hơn có thể gọi tắt là Tâm lý học các dân tộc, hẳn là cuốn sách gây nhiều chỉ trích nhất, gây nhiều chống đối và bất bình nhất trong mọi cuốn sách của Le Bon, và đó là một trong những lý do mãi đến hôm nay, sách mới ra đời… Không chỉ các nhà khoa học xã hội, nhà tâm lý nên đọc cuốn sách này, mà rõ ràng là các quan chức, các chính trị gia, và cả các bạn đang bán hàng, PR/truyền thông.. đều nên đọc và sẽ tìm đc nhiều gợi ý, lời khuyên khi làm việc với đám đông, và hiểu về sự tiến hóa của các dân tộc, và qua đó hiểu về sự tiến hóa của các tổ chức, các nhóm người…\n",

Gặp một đại lộ mang tên Kirkegaard ông rất vui nhưng người bạn liền bảo: \"Anh chớ có lầm, đây không phải là đại lộ Kierkegaard mà là đại lộ nghĩa trang\".

    "description": "Nhiều bạn đọc thắc mắc tại sao lại phải nâng cấp sử dụng phiên bản mới vì tất cả đều cũng chỉ là chỉnh sửa ảnh, tạo ảnh nghệ thuật, thiết kế những tấm quảng cáo bắt mắt, xây dựng giao diện Web tiện dụng… Đó là một trong những vấn đề tập sách Tự Học Photoshop CS6 muốn trình bày đến bạn đọc.\nVấn đề khó khăn thường gặp trong xử lý ảnh là tách đối tượng có nhiều chi tiết mảnh, mềm ra khỏi nền phức tạp. Chương trình Photoshop CS6 đã không ngừng nâng cao tính năng tìm kiếm đối tượng, sản phẩm Refine cho kết quả tốt hơn và thao tác linh hoạt hơn, lấy được những chi tiết mảnh như sợi tóc rất nhanh, không cần chạm vào. Nó thật sự rất tuyệt, nếu muốn tinh chỉnh kết quả, không hủy bỏ tiến trình xử lý và cho phép xem lại bất cứ lúc nào, chỉ cần tinh chỉnh lớp mặt nạ liên quan.\nTrước kia muốn di chuyển một đối tượng từ vị trí này đến vị trí khác rất khó, sẽ mất rất nhiều thời gian để tìm cách lấp đầy khoảng trống còn lại. Nay chỉ trong vài giây bạn có ngay phần nền phù hợp điền vào thay thế.\nCác thiếu sót thông thường của ống kính như là biến dạng barrel và pincushion, làm mờ nét ảnh và quang sai màu, chỉ cần canh thước thẳng hàng là bạn đã có thể điều chỉnh chính xác.\n",

    "description": "Những Kim Tự Tháp Ai Cập vẫn luôn là một nghi vấn lớn đối với nhân loại. Rất rất nhiều những câu hỏi đã được đặt ra, chẳng hạn: Ai đã xây dựng các Kim Tự Tháp? Họ xây dựng Kim Tự Tháp bằng cách nào? Và để làm gì? Nhưng không ai có thể trả lời chúng. Nói đúng hơn, không nhà khoa học nào có thể trả lời.\nNăng lượng Kim Tự Tháp thời đại mới tiết lộ cho người đọc những hiểu biết về Kim Tự Tháp từ các bậc thầy thiền định. Nguồn gốc, mục đích, và nguồn năng lượng phi thường kỳ diệu ẩn tàng trong những Kim Tự Tháp. Năng lượng đó, nếu áp dụng trong đời sống, nó có thể giúp con người chữa lành mọi bệnh tật, làm bình an tâm trí, thăng hoa trong thiền định, bảo quản thực phẩm, tăng năng suất cây trồng... và rất nhiều tác dụng kỳ diệu khác nữa.\nCuốn sách cũng ghi lại những trải nghiệm tâm linh tuyệt diệu của một số người đã từng thiền định trong các Kim Tự Tháp Giza, Kim Tự Tháp Vĩ Đại... Họ đã nằm vào chiếc quan tài bằng đá, đã bị đe dọa bởi những thực thể như ma quỷ, đã tiếp xúc với những thực thể ánh sáng cấp cao, đã nhận những thông điệp - để rồi sứ mệnh của họ là mang thông điệp ấy trao truyền lại cho chúng ta.\nNhững Vị thầy Kim Tự Tháp đang nỗ lực xây dựng Kim Tự Tháp trên khắp thế giới, sao cho năm 2016 toàn thế giới sẽ trở thành một Kim Tự Tháp lớn, Trái đất sẽ được bao bọc trong một nguồn năng lượng thấm đẫm sự yêu thương, bình an. Năng lượng Kim Tự Tháp thời đại mới là cuốn sách ra đời vì nỗ lực đó. Hãy mang cuốn sách này tới với tất cả mọi người, để ngày càng có thêm nhiều Kim Tự Tháp hơn nữa được xây dựng, và cuộc sống con người sẽ ngày càng tốt đẹp, hạnh phúc hơn.\nTrích đoạn\n“Nếu những Kim Tự Tháp này được sử dụng rộng rãi, cuộc sống con người sẽ được kéo dài thêm. Nếu việc này trở thành một bài tập thường xuyên mỗi ngày cho mỗi đứa trẻ, mỗi gia đình, mỗi ngôi trường, mỗi bệnh viện, cuộc sống có thể được kéo dài đến ba trăm năm. Chỉ một giờ mỗi ngày bên trong một Kim Tự Tháp và bạn chẳng cần phải làm gì cả, đơn giản là chỉ ngồi ở đó. Nó sẽ giúp cuộc sống của bạn trở nên tốt đẹp hơn nữa, và một giờ đồng hồ hạnh phúc đó sẽ đưa bạn vào trạng thái Thiền định thật sâu. Nó có ích cho cả hai việc này.”\n(Sự kỳ diệu của Kim Tự Tháp - Osho)\n“Người ta cho rằng con người đi vào trạng thái Alpha của sự tỉnh thức nhanh hơn và dễ dàng hơn khi ở bên trong hoặc bên dưới một Kim Tự Tháp. Kim Tự Tháp mang lại nguồn năng lượng tích cực. Nó gột rửa các năng lượng tiêu cực và thay vào đó những dòng năng lượng của thiên đường.”\n(Các Kim Tự Tháp ở Estonia - Silver Tambur)\n",

    "description": "\"Đặc trưng của nền vật lý hiện đại trong thế kỷ 20 là sự tìm kiếm nguồn gốc khởi thủy của vật chất, cố tìm ra những \"hạt cơ bản\" cuối cùng tạo nên nguyên tử. Thế nhưng, khi đến cánh cửa cuối cùng mở ra để thấy bộ mặt thật của vật chất, nhà vật lý phát hiện vật chất hình như không phải do những hạt cứng chắc tạo thành nữa, mà nó chỉ là dạng xuất hiện của một thực tại khác. Vì thế mà vật chất mang những tính chất hầu như đối nghịch nhau, nó vừa liên tục vừa phi liên tục, vừa hữu hiện vừa phi hữu hiện, dạng xuất hiện của nó tùy theo cách quan sát của con người. Những tính chất lạ lùng đó đưa ngành vật lý vào thẳng cửa ngõ của triết học: nền vật lý hiện đại vừa thống nhất và lý giải nhiều khái niệm cơ bản của triết học, vừa đề ra những câu hỏi lớn của loài người mà các nhà đạo học từ xưa tổng kết. Và kỳ lạ thay, những phát hiện hiện nay của nền vật lý hiện đại không khác bao nhiêu so với những kết luận của các thánh nhân ngày xưa.\nVì những lẽ đó, trước Capra đã có nhiều nhà vật lý xuất sắc của thế kỷ này đến với triết học, nhất là các nhà sáng lập thuyết tương đối và thuyết lượng tử. Họ tìm thấy ở triết học phương đông một thế giới quan hết sức phù hợp để soi rọi cho những vấn đề nan giải của vật chất đề ra. Thế nhưng, với cuốn sách này của Capra, ta có một cái nhìn tổng thể về những thành tựu của vật lý học, về những vấn đề lớn hiện nay làm cho vật lý bị giam trong một cuộc khủng hoảng về nhận thức luận, và về những sự tương đồng nổi bật với các triết lý phương Đông.\nVới tính cách là một giáo sư vật lý, Capra trình bày được một cách cặn kẽ khúc chiết các vấn đề vật lý. Tác giả cũng trình bày khá sâu và chính xác về các nền đạo học phương Đông như Ấn Độ giáo, Phật giáo, Lão giáo. Nhờ am hiểu hai nền học thuật đó mà tác giả cuốn sách này mang lại cho người đọc, dù người đó đến từ phương trời nào, rất nhiều điều bổ ích. Người đọc có kiến thức đạo học phương Đông sẽ nhận thấy, đối với luận đề này, triết lý phương Đông còn cống hiến nhiều hơn nữa so với những gì trong sách trích dẫn.\"\n(Nguyễn Tường Bách)\n",

    "description": "Ai rồi cũng chết! là một tuyệt phẩm đánh động lòng người được viết nên bởi bác sĩ kiêm tác giả best-seller Atul Gawande. Cuốn sách không chỉ có khả năng lay chuyển ngành y học hiện đại, mà nó còn sẽ giúp làm biến đổi hoàn toàn cuộc sống của muôn người - bao gồm chính Bạn!\nNgành y học thế giới đã có nhiều bước phát triển vượt bậc trong những năm qua: giảm thiểu tỉ lệ tử vong trẻ sơ sinh, nâng cao tỉ lệ sống sót sau chấn thương, chữa trị và kiểm soát được nhiều loại bệnh tật - kể cả nhiều căn bệnh từng được xem là không có thuốc chữa trong quá khứ. Nhưng dù có bành trướng hùng mạnh đến đâu, y học vẫn muôn đời bất lực trước quy luật sinh-lão-bệnh-tử bất biến của con người: Mỗi khi con người phải đối diện với Tuổi Già và Cái Chết, những công cụ y học vốn dĩ quyền năng bỗng chốc phản bội lại chính lý tưởng cứu nhân độ thế mà chúng đang phục vụ.\nBằng những công trình nghiên cứu khoa học giá trị và những câu chuyện sống động từ các bệnh nhân và người thân của chính mình, bác sĩ Gawande bóc trần cho chúng ta thấy những hệ lụy và nỗi đau mà con người phải gánh chịu bởi nghịch lý trên. Viện dưỡng lão vốn dĩ được lập ra với mục đích ban đầu tốt đẹp là giúp cho người cao tuổi có một cuộc sống hạnh phúc và viên mãn bất chấp tuổi già, nhưng nhiều nhà dưỡng lão ngày nay bị biến tướng thành những tòa nhà khép kín không khác gì nhà tù, nơi mà người già không được phép ăn những món ăn họ thích và không được phép làm những gì mình muốn. Nhiều bác sĩ được đào tạo xuất sắc về mặt chuyên môn, nhưng lại không biết cách làm thế nào để nói cho bệnh nhân biết sự thật về bệnh tình của họ; thay vào đó, bác sĩ lại vin vào những hy vọng hão huyền về khả năng cứu sống người bệnh của y học và đề xuất cho bệnh nhân hàng loạt biện pháp chữa trị để nuôi những hy vọng hão đó. Rốt cuộc, hành động này chỉ khiến cho người bệnh và cả thân nhân của họ thêm hao mòn khổ sở chứ không hề mang lại ích lợi gì cho họ cả về mặt thể xác lẫn tinh thần.\nTrong những cuốn sách của mình, bác sĩ phẫu thuật Atul Gawande đã dùng ngòi bút mạnh mẽ không chút sợ hãi của mình tiết lộ cho chúng ta biết sự thật đằng sau ngành y cũng như những cuộc chiến mà các thầy thuốc như ông phải đối mặt và tranh đấu vượt qua. Lần này, với tác phẩm Ai rồi cũng chết!, ông phơi bày cho chúng ta thấy những giới hạn và nhược điểm của ngành y - trong cả chuyên môn của ông lẫn những chuyên ngành khác - khi cuộc sống con người bị đe dọa bởi sự lão hóa và cái chết. Qua đó, ông cũng đồng thời khám phá ra rằng mọi chuyện đều có cách giải quyết, rằng chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể làm khác đi, để mang lại cuộc sống tốt đẹp hơn cho mọi người cũng như cho chính bản thân chúng ta.\nĐể khai phá ngọn nguồn mọi vấn đề cũng như giải pháp, bác sĩ Gawande đã theo chân một nữ y tá làm công việc chăm sóc bệnh nhân tại gia, phỏng vấn nhiều người trong giới bác sĩ lão khoa và sinh hoạt cùng họ, và tiếp xúc với những nhà quản lý viện dưỡng lão có tư tưởng cấp tiến và nhân văn. Ông tìm thấy những con người biết cách nói lên sự thật và chứng minh cho cả thế giới thấy, rằng mỗi người chúng ta đều có thể và có quyền mưu cầu cho mình một cuộc sống tốt đẹp và hạnh phúc bất chấp tuổi già sức yếu mà không phải hy sinh những giá trị sống mà chúng ta yêu quý hoặc tôn thờ.\nVới cách kể chuyện chân thực, sống động, mê hoặc và đánh động lòng người của tác giả, quyển sách Ai rồi cũng chết! khẳng định với chúng ta rằng: Mỗi con người sinh ra không phải chỉ để ăn, ngủ hay tồn tại qua ngày, mà chính là để được sống một cuộc sống đúng nghĩa; rằng mục đích cuối cùng của y học không phải để kéo dài sự tồn tại vô nghĩa của con người, mà chính là để giúp chúng ta có một cuộc sống mãi mãi đong đầy hạnh phúc - cho đến tận phút lâm chung!\n",

    "description": "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk là một trong những chính khách quan trọng nhất thế kỷ hai mươi. Ông đã thiết lập và định hình nên nước Cộng hòa Thổ Nhĩ Kỳ mà ngày nay là quốc gia mạnh nhất nằm giữa biển Adriatic và Trung Quốc trong vành đai rộng lớn của đại lục Á - Âu ở phía nam Nga và phía bắc tiểu lục địa Ấn Độ. Với những dân tộc bị thống trị, ông đã chỉ ra một con đường dẫn tới độc lập trong hữu nghị với phần còn lại của thế giới. Ông là người chống chủ nghĩa đế quốc chỉ thuần túy vì lý tưởng hướng tới sự thịnh vượng chung cho nhân loại văn minh. Trên tất cả, ông là một người kiến tạo, một nhà kiến tạo quốc gia vĩ đại nhất thời hiện đại.\nCuốn tiểu sử này đã bóc trần lớp vỏ huyền thoại để lộ ra những phức tạp của con người vĩ đại đằng sau đó, người đã áp đặt sự gắn kết, trật tự và tính hiện đại vào Thổ Nhĩ Kỳ và trong quá trình đó, tạo ra một huyền thoại cũng như sự sùng bái dành cho chính ông.\nNhận định\n\"Lột tả được bức tranh rộng lớn đó qua cuộc đời chỉ một nhân vật, cuốn tiểu sử này thật sự mang màu sắc của một cuốn tiểu thuyết, vừa chi tiết vừa đơn giản với lối văn chương giản dị, rõ ràng. Và một điều rất quan trọng, dù rất ngưỡng mộ Ataturk, Andrew Mango đã dựng nên một bức chân dung hoàn toàn chân thực về một nhà độc tài kiêu ngạo, tàn nhẫn và độc đoán.\"\n(Nguyễn Cảnh Bình)\n\"Một cuốn sách tuyệt vời.

Arrian đã nói rõ về tầm quan trọng của cuốn sách này đối với ông:\n\"Tôi không cần tuyên bố danh tính của mình - mặc dù nó chưa từng được ai biết tới; tôi không cần ghi rõ quê hương tôi và gia đình tôi, hoặc bất kỳ chức vụ hành chính nào mà tôi đã từng nắm giữ. Tôi chỉ muốn nói điều này: rằng cuốn sách này, từ khi tôi còn trẻ, đã quý giá hơn quê hương, dòng họ và sự thăng tiến - quả thực, đối với tôi, nó chính là tất cả những điều đó.\n...Nhưng là một con người, nếu ai đó coi thường Alexander, trước hết anh ta nên tự soi chiếu mình với ngài: bản thân anh ta một kẻ tầm thường, ít tiếng tăm còn Alexander là một Hoàng đế vĩ đại với những thành công mà không ngòi bút nào tả xiết, người cai trì hai lục địa, người mà danh tiếng đã được cả thế gian biết đến. Làm sao có ai đó lăng mạ ngài, khi đó hiểu rằng, sự khinh thị và mục đích tầm thường của anh ta chỉ chứng minh cho sự bất lực của bản thân mà thôi.\"\nArrian đã nắm bắt được một đề tài hấp dẫn, và một cơ hội huy hoàng. Không một ai đã từng viết về Alexander Đại đế nhiều hơn ông. Không một ai, một nhà thơ hoặc nhà văn nào, có được sự công minh như ông. Chừng nào những tác phẩm của những tác giả trước đó (viết về Alexander) còn chứa đựng những sai lầm hiển nhiên, chừng đó một Alexander thực sự còn bị che giấu dưới vô vàn những tuyên bố mâu thuẫn. Cuốn sách của Arrian quả thực đã chấm dứt tình trạng này. Tầm quan trọng của Alexander Đại đế to lớn đến mức Arrian đã không ngần ngại thách thức cả những sử gia Hy Lạp vĩ đại.\n",

Bên cạnh đó chúng ta cũng thấy được một khía cạnh khác, đó là sự xông xáo, trách nhiệm cao độ của các phóng viên làm nhiệm vụ đưa tin trực tiếp về chiến dịch, cập nhật những tin tức mới nhất, kịp thời chuyển ra Hà Nội để đưa tin hàng ngày trên Báo Nhân dân - tờ báo của Đảng.\nVới những nội dung được kể lại, cuốn sách sẽ góp một nguồn tư liệu quý, bổ ích cho việc nghiên cứu về cuộc kháng chiến chống Mỹ, cứu nước của dân tộc ta.\n",

    "description": "Với phương pháp đa ngành cùng khối kiến thức khổng lồ, Jared Diamond đã hoàn thành kiệt tác mang tính cách mạng trong nghiên cứu về lịch sử nhân loại: Sụp đổ - Các xã hội thất bại hay thành công như thế nào? Với cuốn sách này, người đọc sẽ đi từ sự sụp đổ của nền văn minh Maya, đến với sự bùng nổ và suy tàn của người Viking, xem xét sự hưng thịnh và kết cục bi thảm của người Norse ở Greenland…\nNhững nguyên nhân nào được xem là căn bản nhất cho mọi sự diễn tiến hay suy bại của các xã hội trên toàn thế giới? Có thể kiếm tìm một lý giải hay một mô hình cho tất cả những thất bại và thành công của nhân loại hay không? Chúng ta có thể học gì từ sự thất bại của những nền văn minh từng là vĩ đại nhất?\nNhân loại sẽ cần ghi nhớ những điều được Jared Diamond tổng kết: “Chúng ta đang tiến rất nhanh trên con đường không bền vững… nên bằng cách này hay cách khác, các vấn đề môi trường của thế giới sẽ được các thế hệ trẻ hiện nay giải quyết. Vấn đề ở đây là liệu chúng có được giải quyết bằng những cách thích hợp do chính chúng ta chọn lựa hay không, hay bằng những cách tiêu cực mà chúng ta không muốn chọn lựa như chiến tranh, diệt chủng, dịch bệnh và các xã hội sụp đổ. Trong khi tất cả các hiện tượng tàn khốc trên luôn gắn chặt với lịch sử xã hội loài người, nhưng mức độ nghiêm trọng của suy thoái môi trường và áp lực dân số sẽ kéo theo đói nghèo và bất ổn chính trị.\"\nNhận xét về cuốn sách, Tim Falannery cho rằng: Cuốn sách Sụp đổ này cần phải được đọc nghiêm túc. Đây chắc chắn là cuốn sách quan trọng nhất bạn từng đọc. Trong khi đó, diễn giả số 1 thế giới, Malcolm Gladwell, nhận xét: \"Bài học của Sụp đổ là, các xã hội vốn không bị giết chết. Các xã hội thường tự tử: họ tự cắt cổ tay, và trong nhiều thập kỷ sau đó, chỉ biết đứng nhìn mình chảy máu đến chết\".\n",

    "description": "Làng báo Sài Gòn tái hiện một thời kỳ làm báo sôi nổi của trí thức Sài Gòn và Việt Nam, với những tờ báo có số phận chỉ vài tháng hay vài số báo, thậm chí một số báo duy nhất, trong bối cảnh bi thương mà hào hùng của một dân tộc bị mất nước nhưng quyết không cam chịu làm nô lệ.\nNhận định\n\"Cuốn sách là một biên niên sử báo chí thực sự công phu, hấp dẫn.Công trình miêu tả sinh động của Philippe M. F. Peycam tạo ra một đóng góp độc đáo vào lịch sử Việt Nam đương đại và các nhà nghiên cứu về thuộc địa. Cho đến nay, chưa có công trình nào như vậy bằng tiếng Anh. Những nghiên cứu trước đó về báo chí Việt Nam tập trung vào nhật báo cộng sản La Lutte và ít lấy mẫu một cách hệ thống về các ấn bản được người Pháp ủng hộ. Peycam cho chúng ta chân dung về các nhà báo, chủ bút, biên tập - những người, thường là cung cấp tài chính để duy trì, đưa các tờ báo ra với công chúng để thách thức hiện trạng. Ông thận trọng sử dụng các báo cáo của mật vụ Pháp và làm sống lại những con người này cùng sự pha trộn khác thường của về chủ nghĩa lý tưởng Pháp và đạo đức giả thực dân.\"\n(Sophie Quinn-judge, Temple University)\n",

    "description": "\"Tôi vẫn dự định sẽ viết một cuốn sách về nghề báo. Trong hơn hai mươi năm từ ngày tập tễnh học nghề, với những bài báo đã viết, những con người tôi đã gặp, có biết bao nhiêu câu chuyện muốn kể.\nNhiều năm trước tôi nói với một người bạn của mình rằng sẽ viết sách về nghề, một cuốn tiểu thuyết. Cuốn tiểu thuyết thì tôi không viết được, nhưng dự định viết sách về chuyện nghề thì còn đó.\nThỉnh thoảng về nhà ngồi một mình sau ca trực xuất bản, khó ngủ sau một ngày nạp quá nhiều thông tin và suy nghĩ, tôi ngồi lại kiểm đếm xem những xử lý trong ngày của mình, đồng nghiệp đã tốt chưa, khi đó tôi hay liên tưởng đến những tình huống tương tự trước đây. Và trong những lần như thế, những bài học cũ hiện về.\nTôi viết về BÁO CHÍ ĐIỀU TRA, từ những kỷ niệm, những bài học của mình và đồng nghiệp xung quanh, những khó khăn, chút ít thành công, và cả những thất bại mình đã từng trải qua hoặc chứng kiến. Vì thế, bạn sẽ không tìm thấy trong cuốn sách này những trào lưu báo chí, những quan điểm to tát. Chỉ là những câu chuyện nghề của một nhà báo khi thực hiện các bài điều tra.\nTôi không có tham vọng đưa ra những nhận định về báo chí điều tra của cả làng báo. Hơn nữa, tôi không đủ thông tin về công tác tòa soạn, công tác phóng viên của các đồng nghiệp ở các tờ báo khác phía sau các bài điều tra của họ. Tôi viết về những điều mình biết, lần giở ký ức của mình, những ghi chép, tư liệu, những biên bản các cuộc họp trong gần hai thập niên lại đây mà tôi còn lưu giữ được và kể cho các bạn nghe những câu chuyện. Tôi cố gắng để mỗi bài viết đều có thể trở thành một kinh nghiệm, một gợi ý cho các đồng nghiệp trẻ và các em sinh viên chập chững bước vào nghề báo.\nTôi cố gắng sắp xếp và diễn đạt thật giản dị, dễ hiểu. Tôi cấu trúc nó theo cách đã lĩnh hội được từ các khóa nghiệp vụ và sư phạm báo chí mà tôi được học và sau một quá trình hơn 10 năm tham gia đào tạo báo chí.\nVì sao cuốn sách này lại viết về báo chí điều tra mà không là thể loại khác? Báo chí điều tra là thể loại đòi hỏi nhiều kiến thức, kỹ năng từ giao tiếp, phân tích, đánh giá, diễn đạt và xử lý các mối quan hệ. Gần như mọi kỹ năng sống và viết đều ứng dụng được vào nó.\nVới tôi, cuốn sách này như một sự đúc kết những bài học của một chặng đường đầu tiên làm báo, vất vả nhưng hạnh phúc. Mong rằng nó sẽ có ích đối với bạn, và sẽ vui hơn nếu bạn tìm thấy trong đó chút gì thú vị. Được thế, với tôi, đã là điều quá hạnh phúc.\"\n(Đức Hiển)\n",

Chúng ta cần kiểm chứng bao nhiêu người để xác định được người thực sự đã cứu được hai tỷ người.... một con số vẫn tiếp tục tăng lên mỗi phút ?\nVà chúng ta phải tiến về phía trước bao xa trong cuộc sống để cho thấy sự khác biệt mà bạn tạo ra.\nTrong cuốn sách này, Andy Andrews sẽ cung cấp cho chúng ta những ví dụ, cụ thể, sinh động cùng những lời lý giải ngắn gọn, súc tích cho hiện tượng vật lý thú  vị này. Chúng ta sẽ biết rằng, chính những hành động nhỏ bé của mình sẽ là khởi nguồn của các kết quả lớn nhiều năm sau đó. Mọi hành động của chúng ta, dù lớn dù nhỏ cũng gieo một cái nhân (nguyên nhân), từ cái nhân đó sinh sôi nảy nở theo thời gian để tạo nên quả (kết quả).

Việc phân tích và đánh giá ở giai đoạn này có thể đưa ra nhiều ý tưởng phong phú hơn, tuy nhiên, chỉ nên tổng hợp lại các ý tưởng ở cuối quá trình tư duy. Sự tư duy rất cần thiết trong hầu hết những vấn đề quan trọng. Thậm chí, những việc đơn giản như chuẩn bị cho một chuyến đi dã ngoại cũng cần phải có suy tính thấu đáo.

Mức độ làm chủ và gắn kết với sự tổn thương của bản thân sẽ quyết định độ sâu của lòng dũng cảm và sự rõ ràng trong mục tiêu của chúng ta.\nNếu dành cả đời để chờ đến khi chúng ta thật hoàn hảo hay bất khả chiến bại rồi mới bước vào trận địa, thì cuối cùng, chúng ta sẽ để vuột mất các mối quan hệ và những cơ hội có một không hai, chúng ta hoang phí thời gian quý giá và quay lưng lại với những tài năng mà trời phú cho chúng ta, những đóng góp mà chỉ chúng ta mới có thể tạo ra.\nHoàn hảo và bất khả chiến bại đều là những điều rất hấp dẫn nhưng chúng không thực sự tồn tại trong cuộc sống của con người. Chúng ta đều phải can đảm, vững bước đương đầu với khó khăn, dù đó là một mối quan hệ mới, một cuộc họp quan trọng, quá trình sáng tạo của bản thân, hay một cuộc trò chuyện khó khăn với người thân. Đừng đứng ngoài cuộc để đánh giá hay khuyên răn, chúng ta phải dám lộ diện và để người khác nhìn thấy mình. Đó là sự liều lĩnh vĩ đại dám dấn thân dù phải đối mặt tổn thương.\nVà với cuốn sách thú vị Sự Liều Lĩnh Vĩ Đại, tác giả sẽ cùng độc giả khám phá câu trả lời cho những câu hỏi sau:\n• Thứ gì điều khiến nỗi sợ hãi bị tổn thương của chúng ta?\n• Làm sao để bảo vệ bản thân khỏi sự tổn thương?\n• Cái giá phải trả khi ta nhắm mắt và bỏ cuộc là gì?\n• Làm sao để làm chủ và gắn kết với sự tổn thương, để từ đó ta bắt đầu thay đổi cách sống, cách yêu thương, cách làm cha mẹ và lãnh đạo?\n",

    "description": "Khoa học nói chung và y học nói riêng luôn phát triển không ngừng. Tuy nhiên, không bao giờ có cái gì hoàn thiện tuyệt đối, vì thế con người luôn tìm mọi cách hoàn thiện những khiếm khuyết của các thành quả do mình sáng tạo ra để đưa xã hội loài người tiến lên.\nĐông y càng cổ càng giỏi vì ngày xưa chẳng có máy móc thiết bị gì nhưng các vị danh y chẩn đoán và chữa bệnh như thần. Tây y càng mới càng tinh, những thiết bị máy móc hiện đại của Tây y đã giúp chẩn đoán bệnh được chính xác hơn và do đó việc chữa bệnh có hiệu quả hơn. Ngày nay, Đông y và Tây y phát triển ở đỉnh cao, tuy vậy không phải là không có những nhược điểm  trong chẩn bệnh và chữa bệnh. Một ngành y học ra đời để bổ sung cho Đông y và Tây y đó là môn khí công y đạo Việt Nam.\nCuốn sách cung cấp cho bạn những kiến thức về dấu hiệu của người sắp bị bệnh tiểu đường, phân loại bệnh chứng, điều dưỡng, những món ăn thay thuốc phòng và chữa bệnh tiểu đường, những bài thuốc kinh nghiệm chữa bệnh tiểu đường của Đông y.\n",

    "description": "Con người sinh ra đã là một sinh vật luôn trăn trở về mục đích của cuộc sống: Tại sao phải chúng ta tiếp tục sống mặc dù chúng ta đau khổ? Câu trả lời được tìm thấy trong đạo Phật. Đạo Phật dạy chúng ta rằng phải gieo trồng những hạt giống hạnh phúc nếu chúng ta muốn được hạnh phúc.\nNếu bạn gieo hạt hướng dương, bạn sẽ có những bông hướng dương nở rộ.\nNếu bạn gieo hạt violet, bạn sẽ có hoa violet tím biếc.\nNếu bạn gieo hạt cải, bạn sẽ được ngắm hoa cải nở vàng.\nBạn gieo hạt, bạn hưởng thành quả là những bông hoa – đó là quy luật của tự nhiên.\nTương tự như vậy, nếu bạn gieo hạt giống hạnh phúc, những bông hoa hạnh phúc sẽ bung nở. Qua những suy nghĩ, lời nói, hành động thường ngày của mình, bạn đang gieo những hạt giống hạnh phúc hoặc khổ đau. Điều này trong đạo Phật gọi là luật nhân – quả.\nTrong cuộc sống hàng ngày, con người gặp biết bao muộn phiền, nhưng khi soi rõ những muộn phiền đó dưới ánh sáng của luật nhân - quả, ta sẽ tìm ra căn nguyên và từ đó cũng tìm ra cách giải quyết vấn đề. Đó cũng là điều cuốn sách này hướng tới. Bằng việc đưa ra những vấn đề khác nhau ta thường phải đối mặt, lí giải chúng một cách khách quan và đề xuất cách giải quyết hợp lí, chúng tôi hi vọng sẽ giúp độc giả gieo được thật nhiều hạt giống hạnh phúc.\n",

    "description": "“Mẹ!\nCó nghĩa là mãi mãi\nLà - cho - đi - không - đòi - lại - bao - giờ”\n(Thanh Nguyên)\nTrong mỗi người chúng ta, mẹ không chỉ là người sinh ra và nuôi nấng ta, mà còn là người có vị trí thật đặc biệt. Có những món ăn, không ai nấu ngon bằng mẹ, có những sở thích của ta, chỉ mẹ là người hiểu rõ nhất. Ấy mà, cũng có khi, ta làm mẹ buồn, cũng có khi ta mãi vui chơi bên ngoài mà quên mất mẹ đang chờ ta ở nhà, có đôi khi ta làm mẹ khóc chỉ vì những hành động quá vô tâm của ta!Tình cảm thiêng liêng nhất và sâu sắc nhất trên đời cũng là tình thương yêu của người mẹ. Khi chúng ta còn nhỏ, mẹ luôn là người gần gũi, thân thiết nhất với chúng ta, chăm lo cho chúng ta khôn lớn từng ngày. Thế rồi, năm tháng trôi đi, chúng ta dần trưởng thành, bước vào cuộc sống với những ước mơ, bộn bề lo toan. Có những lúc dường như chúng ta đã quên đi mẹ - rồi đến một lúc nào đó, chúng ta chợt giật mình nhận ra, mình đã có lỗi với mẹ. Còn mẹ - dù bất cứ ở đâu - vẫn mãi dõi theo từng bước và luôn yêu thương đứa con của mình! Có những lúc chúng ta sẽ thèm được ở bên mẹ, được mẹ quan tâm, dặn dò và được chăm lo cho mẹ. Có những lúc chúng ta có thể làm được điều đó - nhưng có những lúc thì không, và đôi khi không còn kịp...\nVà sẽ có lúc, chúng ta khát khao được tạ lỗi cùng mẹ…\nVà có lúc chúng ta chợt nhận ra một điều dù bạn dâng tặng mẹ tất cả quà tặng trên đời hay nghìn đóa hoa hồng đỏ thắm thì cũng không bằng được một cái ôm hôn mẹ cùng tình cảm đặc biệt thật sự từ trái tim!\nXin đừng làm mẹ khóc là những câu chuyện giản dị mà đầy ý nghĩa, sâu sắc về người mẹ, về tình mẹ con - một tình yêu thương vô điều kiện và không gì có thể sánh bằng. Trong những trang sách này, bạn sẽ tìm lại được và nhận ra những phút giây đồng cảm trong tình yêu thương, cảm xúc về mẹ, tìm về ký ức tuổi thơ thân thương gắn bó bên mẹ, và cả những suy tư trăn trở về mẹ, về lỗi lầm, về tất cả những gì mẹ đã hy sinh cho chúng ta... Như trong câu chuyện Mẹ và Con - một người mẹ luôn than phiền vì con của cô luôn muốn được ở bên cạnh cô, nhưng cô vì công việc, luôn cảm thấy phiền khi đi cùng con. Rồi đến một ngày, cô cũng hiểu vì sao các con cần cô, nhưng thật buồn, vì khi ấy, con cô đã không còn muốn ở cạnh mẹ nữa. Trong câu chuyện Phép màu của Mẹ cho thấy, làm điều tốt cho con, không có nghĩa là nuông chiều con, như người mẹ trong câu chuyện, đã đối với Ken, một đứa trẻ lên 9, bị chứng bại não, khiếm thính và thiểu năng trí tuệ bẩm sinh. Ken thích tấm ván trượt tuyết nhưng không thể trượt với đôi nạng gỗ. Tuy vậy, với tấm lòng người Mẹ, cô đã giúp Ken trượt được với đôi ván trượt dù phải mất vài ngày Ken mới có thể leo lên trèo xuống tấm ván và hai ống quần rách bươm, lộ ra những vết trầy xước rướm máu. Nhờ sự kiên định và tấm lòng của người mẹ mà cậu bé bại não 9 tuổi ngày nào đã trở thành một người đàn ông có một cuộc sống độc lập và có công việc ổn định.\nLàm mẹ có nghĩa là phải cố gắng từng chút một. Dù có thể bạn đang rất bận rộn, hay rất bận rộn hay rất mệt. Có thể bạn đang muốn rửa chén, thì con bạn muốn xem tivi cùng bạn, có thể bạn đã mệt và muốn nghỉ ngơi, nhưng con bạn muốn cùng bạn làm bánh. Có thể bạn đã mệt mỏi, bạn chỉ muốn ngủ, thì con bạn vẫn muốn bạn đọc cho nghe một câu chuyện cổ tích. Như cô bé Erica trong câu chuyện Làm Mẹ, luôn mong mẹ chơi với mình. Cô bé đã khiến mẹ hạnh phúc khi nói rằng: “Không ai trên đời này yêu mẹ nhiều bằng con đâu”. Chân dung Người Mẹ là hình ảnh bất biến và mãi trường tồn với thời gian, thách thức mọi xa cách và ngăn trở không gian. Hình ảnh đó giúp chúng ta không chỉ có đủ sức mạnh để đi đến tận cùng con đường đã lựa chọn mà còn có đủ niềm tin để luôn hướng về phía ánh sáng trên từng chặng đường ta qua. Và đến một ngày nào đó, mỗi chúng ta lại trở thành những bậc cha mẹ tiếp tục ban tặng cho thế hệ mai sau tình yêu thương cao đẹp của mình…\nXin được dành tặng cuốn sách này cho tất cả những người Mẹ và những đứa con biết yêu thương Mẹ.\n",

    "description": "\"Khi còn trẻ, hãy ra ngoài nhiều hơn ở nhà. Hãy nhào vô xin người khác “bóc hết, lột sạch” khả năng của mình. Chỉ sợ bất tài nộp hồ sơ “xin việc”, mà chả ai thèm cho, chả ai thèm bóc lột. Khi đã được bóc và lột hết, dù sau này đi đâu, làm gì, bạn đều cực kỳ thành công. Vì năng lực được trui rèn trong quá trình làm cho người khác. Sự chăm chỉ, tính kỷ luật, quen tay quen chân, quen ngáp, quen lười… cũng từ công việc mà ra. Mọi ông chủ vĩ đại đều từng là những người làm công ở vị trí thấp nhất. Họ đều rẽ trái trong khi mọi người rẽ phải. Họ có những quyết định không theo đám đông, không cam chịu sống một cuộc đời tầm thường, nhạt nhòa… rồi chết.\nCòn những bạn thu nhập 6 triệu cũng túng thiếu, 20 triệu cũng đi vay mượn để tiêu dùng, thì thôi, cuộc đời họ chấm dứt giấc mơ lớn. Tiền nong cá nhân quản lý không được, thì làm sao mà quản trị tài chính một cơ nghiệp lớn?”. Tư duy thế nào thì nó ra số phận thế đó.\"\n(Tony buổi sáng)\nTrên đường băng là tập hợp những bài viết được ưa thích trên Facebook của Tony Buổi Sáng. Nhưng khác với một tập tản văn thông thường, nội dung các bài được chọn lọc có chủ đích, nhằm chuẩn bị về tinh thần, kiến thức…cho các bạn trẻ vào đời. Sách gồm 3 phần: “Chuẩn bị hành trang”, “Trong phòng chờ sân bay” và “Lên máy bay”, tương ứng với những quá trình một bạn trẻ phải trải qua trước khi “cất cánh” trên đường băng cuộc đời, bay vào bầu trời cao rộng.\nNhững bài viết của Tony sinh động, thiết thực, hài hước và xuất phát từ cái tâm trong sáng của một người đi trước nhiều kinh nghiệm. Anh viết về thái độ với sự học và kiến thức nói chung, cách ứng phó với những trắc trở thử thách khi đi làm, cách sống hào sảng nghĩa tình văn minh…truyền cảm hứng cho các bạn trẻ sống hết mình, trọn vẹn từng phút giây. Tuy đối tượng độc giả chính mà cuốn sách hướng đến là các bạn trẻ, nhưng độc giả lớn tuổi hơn vẫn có thể đọc sách để hiểu và có cách hỗ trợ con em mình một cách đúng đắn, chứ không “ủ” con quá kỹ để rồi tạo ra một thế hệ yếu ớt, không biết tự lập. Những người đi làm nhiều năm đọc sách cũng có thể nhìn lại con đường đi của mình, tự ngẫm đó đã phải là con đường mình muốn đi chưa, bởi thay đổi không bao giờ là quá muộn.\n",

Kiểu nhảy này vẫn được dùng cho đến ngày nay.\nAnh đã nhảy cao hơn bất kỳ vận động viên nào trước đó bằng cách nghĩ ngược lại với mọi người. Ví dụ này chỉ để minh họa cho một kỹ thuật suy nghĩ nhưng ở đây kỹ thuật suy nghĩ đã trở thành kỹ thuật nhảy cao, chuyển một cú nhảy vượt xà tưởng như có thể thất bại thành một thành công.\nThế giới chính là những gì bạn nghĩ về nó. Vì vậy, hãy nghĩ về nó theo cách khác đi và cuộc sống của bạn sẽ thay đổi. Khi bạn nhìn lại sẽ có những thứ bạn cảm thấy hối tiếc. Bạn nghĩ mình đã từng quyết định sai lầm.\nSai rồi\nDù quyết định thế nào, đó cũng là quyết định duy nhất. Mọi thứ ta làm đều cho ta chọn lựa. Vậy thì có gì phải hối tiếc?\n",

    "description": "\"Lần đầu tiên khi tôi khám phá ra sức mạnh của lý do TẠI SAO là khi tôi cần đến nó trong cuộc đời mình. Nó không phải là kết quả của việc theo đuổi con đường học vấn của tôi. Nó đã xuất hiện khi tôi không còn cảm hứng với công việc của mình và cảm thấy vô cùng chán nản và thất vọng. Thực tế là đã không có vấn đề gì xảy ra với công việc của tôi, mà do tôi đã đánh mất niềm vui trong công việc mình làm. Nếu xét trên phương diện bề ngoài thì tôi nên vui mới phải. Tôi đã nhận được những khoản thù lao tốt và được làm việc với những đối tác tuyệt vời. Nhưng tôi đã trở nên vô cảm với những gì mình làm. Tôi không còn cảm thấy hài lòng với công việc của mình và cần tìm ra cách để nhóm lên ngọn lửa nhiệt huyết và đam mê thêm một lần nữa. Việc khám phá tầm quan trọng của lý do TẠI SAO đã hoàn toàn thay đổi cái nhìn của tôi về thế giới. Và việc khám phá ra lý do TẠI SAO của chính mình đã giúp tôi tìm lại được niềm đam mê còn cháy bỏng hơn gấp bội so với trước đây.\nTôi đã chia sẻ ý tưởng vô cùng đơn giản, mạnh mẽ và thực tế này với bạn bè. Khi học hỏi được điều gì có giá trị, chúng tôi thường chia sẻ nó với những người mình yêu mến. Thật tuyệt vời vì những người bạn tôi đã bắt đầu có những thay đổi lớn lao trong cuộc đời. Và họ đã mời tôi chia sẻ ý tưởng này với bạn bè của họ và những người mà họ yêu mến. Từ đó ý tưởng này bắt đầu được lan truyền. Chính tại thời điểm này tôi đã quyết định biến mình thành vật thí nghiệm. Bởi vì tôi không thể chia sẻ và đề cao một khái niệm mà chính tôi cũng không thực hiện. Vì vậy tôi đã cố gắng thực hành nó nhiều nhất có thể. Lý do duy nhất khiến tôi được như ngày hôm nay, được sống và làm việc với lý do TẠI SAO của mình, đó là nhờ sự giúp đỡ của tất cả mọi người.\nTôi không có những nhân viên quảng cáo, và cũng không thường xuyên được lên báo chí. Mặc dù vậy khái niệm TẠI SAO vẫn đang được lan truyền rộng rãi bởi vì nó được cộng hưởng sâu thẳm trong thâm tâm người khác khiến họ chia sẻ nó với những người mà họ yêu thương và quan tâm. Cuốn sách này giúp tôi có cơ hội để lan tỏa chiều sâu của ý tưởng này tới tất cả mọi người mà không cần sự có mặt của tôi. Bài nói chuyện trên TEDx của tôi được đăng trên trang ted.com đã tự nó lan truyền rộng rãi mà không cần đến bất cứ chiến lược truyền thông nào. Nó được lan truyền như vậy bởi vì thông điệp này tự nó vốn lạc quan và đầy tính nhân văn. Vì vậy những ai tin tưởng vào nó sẽ tự động chia sẻ nó. Càng có nhiều cá nhân và tổ chức biết cách bắt đầu với lý do TẠI SAO, sẽ càng có nhiều người thức dậy mỗi ngày với cảm giác mãn nguyện với công việc họ đang làm. Và đó là lý do tốt nhất tôi có thể nghĩ tới để tiếp tục chia sẻ ý tưởng này.\"\n(Simon Sinek)\n",

Những ước mơ đáng quý, đáng trân trọng đó luôn là niềm hy vọng, là nguồn động lực và niềm tin lớn nhất cho mỗi người để sống, để cảm nhận và hướng đến ngày mai.\nNhưng cuộc sống luôn tìm ẩn những trở ngại, khó khăn, và thử thách bất ngờ - con đường đi đến những ước mơ ấy không hề bằng phẳng. Bao khó khăn, trở ngại và cả bất hạnh có thể xảy ra vào những lúc không mong chờ nhất như để thử thách lòng dũng cảm của con người. Đó có thể là những trở ngại nhỏ ta vấp phải vào một thời điểm nào đó trước khi tự đứng thẳng trên đôi chân của mình. Có thể nó như những đám mây đen kịt báo hiệu cơn dông, khiến ngay cả những tâm hồn dũng cảm nhất cũng phải tìm kiếm chở che. Cũng có thể do khách quan hay là những ngục tù mà chính ta tự đưa mình vào... khiến ta tổn thương, mất niềm tin, và có lúc tưởng như không còn điểm tựa hay nghị lực để vượt qua. Trước những khó khăn thử thách ấy, mỗi người sẽ tự chọn cho mình cách đón nhận, đối đầu để có một hướng đi riêng. Có những phó thác cho số phận, có người trốn chạy để tìm nơi trú ẩn, có người tự thay đổi để thích nghi với hoàn cảnh mới, cũng có người ngã gục trong cơn giông tố cuộc đời...\nThế nhưng, bất kể là ai, tự đáy lòng của mỗi con người đều tồn tại một khát vọng mãnh liệt - đó chính là khát vọng sống - và được luôn là chính mình. Chính khát vọng ấy đã khiến bao trái tim trăn trở, thao thức tìm cho mình một cách nghĩ, một sức mạnh tinh thần, một hướng đi để theo đuổi những hoài bão, ước mơ của mình. Cuốn sách Những Câu Chuyện Cuộc Sống sẽ là người bạn đồng hành cùng độc giả vượt qua những khó khăn thử thách trong cuộc sống thường ngày, những nỗi mất mát, tổn thương tinh thần, tình cảm, những thăng trầm trên bước đường theo đuổi ước mơ của cuộc đời và vươn lên vì cuộc sống tốt đẹp hơn.\n",

Những gì Taleb nhận diện và gọi là “khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh” là loại sự việc chẳng những hưởng lợi từ hỗn loạn mà cần có hỗn loạn để tồn tại và phát triển.\nTrong cuốn Thiên Nga Đen, Taleb cho thấy những biến cố tưởng chừng không thể xảy ra và không thể nào dự đoán thường làm nền tảng cho gần như mọi thứ trong thế giới chúng ta. Trong Khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh, Taleb khẳng định vai trò quan trọng của tính bất định, làm cho nó trở lên đáng mong đợi, thậm chí cần thiết, và đề xuất sự việc nên được xây dựng sao cho có khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh. Khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh không chỉ là sự mạnh mẽ hay khả năng phục hồi. Khả năng phục hồi chỉ có thể chịu đựng những cú sốc và trở về nguyên trạng; trong khi khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh nghĩa là trở lên ngày càng tốt hơn. Hơn nữa, khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh còn miễn nhiễm trước những dự đoán sai lầm và được bảo vệ trước những biến cố bất lợi.\nTại sao các thành bang tốt hơn các nhà nước tập quyền, tại sao nợ nần có hại cho bạn, và tại sao những gì là “hiệu quả” thật ra không hiệu quả chút nào? Tại sao phản ứng của chính phủ và các chính sách xã hội lại bảo vệ kẻ mạnh và làm tổn thương kẻ yếu? Tại sao bạn nên viết thư từ chức thậm chí trước khi nhận công việc? Tại sao vụ đắm tạo Titanic đã cứu nhiều sinh mệnh? Quyển sách này bao trùm vấn đề phát minh đổi mới thông qua thử nghiệm sai và sửa sai, các quyết định trong đời sống, chính trị, quy hoạch đô thị, chiến tranh, tài chính cá nhân, các hệ thống kinh tế, và y khoa. Và xuyên suốt quyển sách, còn vang lên tiếng nói và giải pháp rõ ràng của các bậc hiền triết cổ đại La Mã, Hy Lạp, Xemit, và thời Trung Cổ.\nKhả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh là thiết kế chi tiết để sống trong một thế giới Thiên Nga Đen. Uyên bác và hóm hỉnh thông điệp của Taleb mang tính cách mạng: Khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh, và chỉ với khả năng cải thiện nghịch cảnh, sự việc mới có thể tồn tại và phát triển.\nNhận định\n\"Tiếng nói tiên tri nhất... Tabel là một triết gia thực thụ... người có thể làm thay đổi cách chúng ta xem xét cấu trúc thế giới thông qua sức thuyết phục, tính độc đáo và xác thực trong những ý tưởng của riêng ông.\"\n(GQ)\n\"Làm thay đổi quan niệm của tôi về sự vận hành thế giới.\"\n(Daniel Kahneman)\n\"Đã làm thay đổi tư duy hiện đại.\"\n(The Times)\n",

Cuộc phiêu lưu của cậu là một chuỗi ngày tháng khó khăn, vất vả những cũng không thiếu những điều thú vị, những bài học quý giá, để rồi từ đó, tác giả đã giúp chúng ta hiểu ra những triết lý sâu sắc nhất của cuộc sống: “Đôi khi người ta phải đi cả một cuộc hành trình dài, với bao hiểm nguy vất vả, chỉ để hiểu rằng, hạnh phúc ở ngay dưới chân ta, ở nơi mà ta đã từng bước qua.”\n3.

Tại sao phản ứng của chính phủ và các chính sách xã hội lại bảo vệ kẻ mạnh và làm tổn thương kẻ yếu? Tại sao bạn nên viết thư từ chức thậm chí trước khi nhận công việc?

    "description": "“Chúng ta sẽ trở thành điều mà chúng ta hay nghĩ đến nhất. Cuộc cách mạng vĩ đại nhất của thời đại này là khám phá ra rằng, nhờ thay đổi thái độ từ trong chính nội tâm mà con người có thể thay đổi được cả thế giới bên ngoài.” (William James)\n“Bạn là sản phẩm của sự di truyền, môi trường, thể xác, tâm trí và tiềm thức. Bạn chịu ảnh hưởng của không gian, thời gian, và hơn thế là những sức mạnh vô hình mà bạn có thể hoặc không thể tự nhận biết. Khi suy nghĩ với tinh thần tích cực, bạn có thể tác động, sử dụng, điều khiển, hoà hợp hay cân bằng lại bất cứ, hoặc tất cả các yếu tố trên. Bạn đủ khả năng định hướng cho suy nghĩ, làm chủ cảm xúc và tạo ra số phận của mình. Bạn là tinh thần trong một thể xác. (W. Clement Stone) Đời sống là một hành trình dài mà bất cứ ai sinh ra trên trái đất này cũng phải trải qua. Hành trình ấy đi qua những đâu: những mảnh đất trù phú, những thiên đường danh vọng, giàu sang hay những mảnh đất khô cằn, những sa mạc mênh mông? Điều này phụ thuộc vào con đường chúng ta chọn lựa để đặt chân lên.\nCon đường ấy sẽ được thái độ của chúng ta dẫn dắt. Hướng tới ánh sáng hay bước vào bóng đêm, chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể thấy trước được để tự quyết cho mình. Cuộc sống là không giới hạn, đích đến cuối cùng của hành trình này lại là điểm khởi đầu ở bất cứ hoàn cảnh nào, hãy tin rằng, chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể thay đổi được cuộc đời mình. Hãy loại trừ ngay những cái nhìn cũ kỹ, hao mòn và tiêu cực về thế giới, thay vào đó, ngắm nhìn thế giới bằng sức sống mãnh liệt đang trào dâng. Trong hành trình ấy, hãy mang niềm hy vọng theo cùng - niềm hy vọng về những gì mà tinh thần tích cực sẽ mang lại cho bạn.\nĐạt được những ích lợi trên chính là mục tiêu của bạn từ hôm nay. Không điều gì có thể cản trở bạn, và điều duy nhất bạn cần làm là tận tâm thực hiện những gì được chỉ dẫn, để mở đường cho những điều tốt đẹp đang đến.\nCuốn Chìa khóa tư duy tích cực sẽ là công cụ hữu ích, là người bạn đường đáng tin cậy giúp bạn thực hiện điều trên. Khi dõi theo và từng bước thực hiện những nguyên tắc trong quyển sách này, bạn sẽ trở thành người tích cực và dần dần đạt được ước mơ của mình cũng như tìm thấy chìa khoá mở cánh cửa thành công.\n",

    "description": "Cuốn sách đầu tiên của người Việt hướng dẫn chi tiết về việc đi du lịch.\n“Hầu hết mọi người đều thích du lịch, và hầu hết người trẻ đều thích du lịch bụi. Nhưng làm thế nào để có thể đi? Nếu bạn đang tự hỏi câu đó, thì tôi có tin mừng cho bạn: du lịch bụi không phải là chế tạo tên lửa. Nó dễ thôi, và không tốn nhiều tiền như ta tưởng.”\nRosie Nguyễn đã mở đầu cuốn sách nhỏ này một cách thẳng thắn, mộc mạc và hài hước như thế. Đó cũng là cách mà cô “dẫn dắt” người đọc trong suốt hành trình Ta ba lô trên đất Á - cuốn sách đầu tiên của một tác giả Việt hướng dẫn chi tiết về việc đi du lịch.\nMột vài năm trở lại đây, sách viết về đề tài du lịch ngày càng nhận được nhiều sự quan tâm của độc giả trẻ. Tuy nhiên, có nhiều ý kiến cho rằng: sách du ký truyền cho người trẻ cảm hứng sống và xê dịch, nhưng không trực tiếp đến mức khuyến khích hay trở thành động lực để độc giả đọc xong là có thể “xách ba lô và lên đường”. Lý do là bởi những cuốn sách du ký thường tập trung vào việc kể lại những trải nghiệm, suy nghĩ của tác giả nhưng lại thiếu đi rất nhiều thông tin cần thiết, cụ thể để độc giả có thể tự thực hiện được một hành trình của riêng mình.\nNhưng rõ ràng, “du lịch bụi” không nên chỉ là một cụm từ hay một ý niệm để người trẻ đôi khi mơ màng nghĩ tới rồi chậc lưỡi. Du lịch bụi nên là một kế hoạch cụ thể. Và Ta ba lô trên đất Á ra đời để giúp bạn hiện thực kế hoạch đó.\nCuốn sách được chia làm nhiều chương. Chương đầu tiên dẫn người đọc đến với thế giới phượt: thế nào là phượt, phượt thì cần những gì, phượt để làm gì? Chương thứ hai là những hướng dẫn quan trọng và thực tế để phượt, từ việc tìm thông tin ở đâu, nên lựa chọn điểm đến và hành trình như thế nào, cho đến những điều nên chú ý khi đi phượt, thậm chí còn bao gồm cả một danh sách mẫu những đồ dùng cần mang theo khi phượt. Các chương tiếp theo đầy ắp kiến thức về văn hóa, lịch sử, địa lý, con người ở các quốc gia, những kinh nghiệm du lịch cụ thể, những câu chuyện, trải nghiệm thú vị, chân thực và đầy cảm xúc trên từng cung đường tác giả đã đi qua. Tất cả được viết với một văn phong giản dị, gần gũi nhưng không kém phần sâu sắc và dí dỏm. Một trong những điểm đặc biệt khác cần ghi nhận ở cuốn sách này, đó là góc nhìn rất thực tế và khách quan của tác giả. Là một phượt thủ, một kẻ yêu xê dịch, sống để được đi, nhưng Rosie Nguyễn không hề cực đoạn khi nói về phượt, không cường điệu, không tô vẽ.\nNhư một người bạn chân thành, hòa nhã và hiểu biết, Ta ba lô trên đất Á giúp bạn mở cánh cửa để có một cái nhìn thực tế và rõ nét về phượt, để bạn biết được nên bắt đầu từ đâu và như thế nào, khi bạn đã sẵn sàng rồi, lựa chọn có “xách ba lô lên và đi” hay không là của bạn. Có thể bạn là một người trẻ, khao khát mơ về chuyến đi đầu tiên của mình nhưng không biết làm cách nào để bắt đầu? Hoặc bạn là một người đã đi nhiều nơi, nhưng chỉ đi theo tour và đang tìm hiểu về du lịch bụi? Hay bạn là một phượt tử đã đi được kha khá nơi, nhưng vẫn muốn biết xem quyển sách này có gì hay ho mới mẻ? Nếu vậy, thì đây là quyển sách dành cho bạn.\n",

Cha cho con hình hài và nâng bước con bằng đôi cánh của sự hy sinh thầm lặng. Cha cho con lòng dũng cảm để đương đầu với mọi thử thách của cuộc sống. Cha cho con sức mạnh để vững bước trên con đường đời. Trên hết, cha cho con niềm tin vào sự kỳ diệu của tình yêu thương và sự bao dung.\nNếu một ngày kia vấp ngã trên đường đời, sự nghiệp phá sản, tình yêu đỗ vỡ hay bị ai đó phản bội...bạn hãy nghĩ về cha cùng những kỳ vọng mà người đã đành cho bạn. Hãy để cha trở thành niềm an ủi cho bạn trong những phút giây yếu lòng.

Nhưng theo Olivia Fox Cabane thì điều đó hoàn toàn không đúng, thế nên chị đã viết quyển sách đột phá này. Bất kỳ ai cũng có thể học và hoàn thiện kỹ năng tạo sức hút cho bản thân mình.\nDựa trên những kỹ thuật chị từng giảng dạy ở Đại học Harvard và MIT, Cabane phân nhỏ ý niệm sức hút ấy thành từng phần cơ bản, hé lộ những bí mật về bản chất của sức hút cũng như tác dụng của nó. Trở nên hấp dẫn hơn không có nghĩa là bạn thay đổi bản chất con người thật của mình. Chẳng qua bạn sẽ học thêm những hành vi cụ thể phù hợp với tính cách sẵn có.\nSức hút cá nhân rất có thể là yếu tố đắt giá cho bạn trong quá trình nộp đơn xin việc, lãnh đạo một tổ chức, hoặc nỗ lực cải thiện các mối quan hệ. Nó còn giúp các y bác sĩ thuyết phục bệnh nhân tuân thủ quá trình điều trị. Nó giúp mọi người nổi bật trong những bữa tiệc và tạo ấn tượng trong lần hò hẹn đầu tiên. Nó thậm chí còn hữu dụng cho các sinh viên muốn hoàn thành xuất sắc đợt phỏng vấn nhập học, và cho cả các giảng viên muốn mang đến những bài giảng đáng nhớ cho sinh viên của mình.\nLạ lùng thay, bạn không nhất thiết phải là người sôi nổi, quảng giao mới học được cách trở thành người cuốn hút. Tính cách hướng nội có khi lại vô cùng đáng giá. Và nói thế càng không có nghĩa bạn phải hấp dẫn về mặt hình thức, ngược lại, khi luyện tập khả năng thu hút từ bên trong, bạn sẽ khiến người ngoài nhận thấy bạn quyến rũ hơn hẳn.\nTác phẩm Ngộ Nhận Về Sức Hút Cá Nhân cung cấp cho bạn cách thức tạo sức ảnh hưởng mạnh mẽ hơn, thuyết phục hơn và truyền cảm hơn.

    "description": "Vấn đề là thứ mà chúng ta luôn gặp phải trong cuộc sống hàng ngày,nó xuất hiện khắp mọi nơi và rất khác nhau, tính lớn nhỏ, đơn giản hay phức tạp của vấn đề rất đa dạng và tùy thuộc vào bản chất của vấn đề và đối tượng gặp phải. Nhưng dù vậy, quá trình để giải quyết vấn đề là hoàn toàn giống nhau. Thay vì giải quyết vấn đề theo bản năng hay những phương pháp không nhất quán có khả năng đưa đến những hiệu ứng phụ không lường trước được, cũng như không tìm ra giải pháp tối ưu cho vấn đề, hiểu và sử dụng bản đồ tư duy đúng cách sẽ loại bỏ được rủi ro và tìm ra phương án giải quyết tốt nhất.\nVậy bí quyết để giải quyết vấn đề là gì? Cuốn sách này sẽ giúp bạn tìm hiểu và khám phá các bước để cải thiện và xử lý vấn đề thông qua việc sử dụng bản đồ tư duy.\nNội dung sách gồm 3 phần:\nPhần I: Khả năng giải quyết vấn đề bằng bản đồ tư duy\nPhần II: Năm bước giải quyết vấn đề bằng bản đồ tư duy\nPhần III: Tám lời khuyên\n",

    "description": "Nếu chúng ta có một thứ giống như miếng đề-can dán xe toàn quốc, thì miếng đề-can của năm sẽ là: “Tôi thất nghiệp, tôi không tìm được việc làm, và tôi đã thử mọi cách.”\nTất nhiên không phải ai cũng trưng nó ra; dù sao cũng có khoảng 139.000.000 người ở Mỹ có việc làm. Nhưng khoảng 15.000.000 người khác thì không. Và 6.000.000 người trong số đó sẽ trưng miếng đề-can đó suốt hơn 27 tháng. Đó là số lượng người thất nghiệp trong khoảng thời gian dài đến vậy. Chỉ trong phạm vi nước Mỹ. Ra khỏi biên giới nước này thì, bi kịch thay, thất nghiệp là một vấn đề toàn cầu, như chúng ta đã thấy ở khắp Trung Đông năm nay, cũng như ở các quốc gia luôn vận động không ngừng khác trên thế giới.\nTrong những ngày này, đi đâu ta cũng nghe lời than vãn như: “Tôi thất nghiệp mãi thôi, tôi không tìm được việc, dù tôi đã cố gắng lắm rồi.” Và chúng ta thật sự rất cố gắng. Thường là trong vô vọng. Chúng ta bị đá khỏi công việc, chúng ta đi tìm việc theo cách trước nay vẫn làm, nhưng lần này chúng ta về tay không. Đây là một trải nghiệm hoàn toàn mới đối với nhiều người trong chúng ta. Và là một kinh nghiệm ta không lường trước được. Mọi cách đều vô ích. Và thất nghiệp cứ thế kéo dài.\nĐiều này làm ta nao núng, và thường khiến lòng tự trọng trong ta suy giảm. Cặp song sinh “chán nản và vô vọng” thường xuyên theo sát nhau. Cuộc sống như thể sẽ không bao giờ khá hơn được. Điều này dường như kéo dài mãi mãi.\nChúng ta cần gì?\nỪm, chúng ta cực kỳ cần một công việc. Dĩ nhiên.\nNhưng hơn thế, khi thất nghiệp, chúng ta vô cùng, vô cùng cần đến Hy Vọng.\nVì thế, trong những năm qua, tác giả đã thu thập vô số tài liệu về tất cả những thứ tác động đến công việc của chúng ta cũng như khả năng chúng ta nuôi sống bản thân và gia đình: ba thảm họa khủng khiếp ở Nhật Bản; làn sóng biểu tình của những quân đoàn người trẻ tuổi thất nghiệp và các đối tượng khác trên khắp Trung Đông; động đất tàn phá ở Haiti, New Zealand, và những nơi khác; vụ tràn dầu BP ở Vịnh Mexico; BRIC (các nền kinh tế đang lên của Brazil, Nga, Ấn Độ và Trung Quốc và sự thèm khát của họ đối với nhiên liệu cùng mọi thứ khác); tỷ lệ thất nghiệp không suy giảm trên khắp thế giới; các món nợ quốc gia tăng vọt trên toàn cầu; áp dụng chính sách thắt chặt ngân sách, trên khắp thế giới; những con số thảm hại về tịch thu nhà cửa để gán nợ; nhà cửa mất giá; mất việc làm ở những ngành nghề cụ thể; thu hẹp tín dụng; xăng dầu tăng giá; thực phẩm tăng giá và thiếu hụt; tuổi làm việc cao hơn; thương mại tự do; thuê ngoài; điện thoại iPhone, máy tính bảng iPad, hệ điều hành Android, Web 2.0, truyền thông xã hội, Facebook, Twitter, blog, nhắn tin, chức năng iCloud, LinkedIn, LinkUp, Checkster, Workblast (hồ sơ cá nhân bằng video), và các công cụ tìm kiếm bao trùm đặc biệt cách thức tìm việc; các kỹ năng mềm; các danh mục đầu tư; phỏng vấn hành vi; hiệp hội các nhà tư vấn; và các câu chuyện tìm việc của từng cá nhân. Chưa kể, mỗi năm 4 lần, mỗi lần khoảng 5 ngày, tác giả không làm gì khác ngoài việc tương tác với những người tìm việc hoặc thay đổi công việc. Thông qua những tương tác cá nhân đó, tác giả được cập nhật về những vấn đề hiện tại mà nam giới và nữ giới đang vấp phải, trong Giới Thất Nghiệp.\nGiờ đây công việc của tác giả là viết cô đọng, chắt lọc núi thông tin thành những điều căn bản, tìm ra những ý tưởng mang lại hy vọng cho người đọc. Bởi vì suy cho cùng, đây là một Quyển Sách Hy Vọng, được ẩn đằng sau vỏ bọc của một quyển cẩm nang tìm việc.\n",

    "description": "Dường như thế giới chúng ta đang sống ngày càng bị cuốn vào vòng xoáy không ngừng của sự bận bịu hối hả, chứa đựng bao hệ luỵ của đời sống công nghiệp hiện đại. Công việc chất chồng, ra đường thì kẹt xe và khói bụi, điện thoại kêu inh ỏi cả trong giấc ngủ..... Tất cả những điều này có vẻ đã trở thành một phần không thể chối bỏ của cuộc sống ngày nay. Hơn lúc nào hết, con người cảm thấy mình cần một trạng thái bình yên, một cảm nhận hạnh phúc - một hạnh phúc không mâu thuẫn với sự thành đạt đòi hỏi sự nỗ lực hằng ngày trong cuộc sống của chúng ta.\nSức mạnh của lòng kiên nhẫn của M.J.Ryan sẽ mang đến giải pháp cho những vấn đề trên. Tác giả nhận thấy rằng những đức tính cao đẹp muôn thuở luôn có sức mạnh đem lại ánh sáng và tình yêu cho cuộc đời chúng ta. Trong cuốn sách này, Ryan sẽ tiết lộ cho chúng ta thấy bằng cách nào mà lòng kiên nhẫn có thể giúp ta làm chậm lại nhịp sống và ngày càng có những cảm nhận tốt đẹp hơn về chính mình. Sự kiên nhẫn sẽ giúp chúng ta phát huy tối đa năng lực bản thân, cho ta khả năng chiến thắng những cơn nóng giận khiến ta phải hối tiếc sau này, giúp ta có sức mạnh theo đuổi và đạt được những điều lớn lao tưởng chừng vượt ngoài tầm với.\nRyan biết rất rõ nếu chỉ cố gắng kiên nhẫn thôi thì chưa đủ. Bà còn chia sẻ với chúng ta một thái độ cần có để giúp ta luôn có thể duy trì và củng cố lòng kiên nhẫn. Nếu bạn mong đợi bản thân tiến dần đến sự hoàn thiện và luôn luôn học hỏi, nếu bạn nhận thấy giá trị của việc kiên trì gỡ rối một vấn đề thay vì chỉ đơn giản né tránh nó, và nếu bạn ý thức rằng còn có nhiều cách giải quyết khác nhau cho cùng một sự việc thì lòng kiên nhẫn của bạn sẽ tăng dần theo thời gian cùng với hạnh phúc thật sự trong hiện tại. Và cao hơn hết là cảm giác mãn nguyện, hài lòng với chính mình.\n",

    "description": "Suốt quá trình viết quyển sách này, tác giả kể nhiều chuyện đời mình và chuyện đời của những người mà cô ấy phỏng vấn, đưa ra “những hành động nhỏ” để hiện thực hóa ý tưởng. Ngoài ra, tác giả còn chia sẻ một số bài học gợi cảm hứng mà bản thân đã thẩm thấu được, gồm có:\nHạnh phúc bắt nguồn từ việc kết nối với cộng đồng và xây dựng các mối quan hệ bền vững.\nTiền có thể mua được hạnh phúc nhưng còn tùy vào cách chi tiêu.\nDư dả của cải không khiến bạn hạnh phúc về lâu dài.\nHọc cách “có ít hơn mà vui hơn” là một phương pháp tìm kiếm hạnh phúc, giành lại thời gian và sống theo chuẩn mực của riêng bạn.\nBất cứ hình thức thay đổi cuộc sống nào cũng đòi hỏi nỗ lực, lòng kiên nhẫn và thái độ sẵn sàng tiếp nhận quan điểm mới.\nChúng ta sẽ cùng tìm hiểu cụ thể những bài học trong quyển sách này. Về cơ bản, quyển sách này là lời mời gọi bạn suy ngẫm về các mối quan hệ với tiền bạc, thời gian và của cải vật chất, đồng thời cân nhắc lại những thứ mang đến hạnh phúc cho bạn. Quyển sách đưa ra một quan điểm khác biệt, một góc nhìn khích lệ bạn xem xét những ý tưởng và những lựa chọn mới mẻ so với lẽ thông thường.\nÝ tưởng sống giản dị đi kèm với nhiều tên gọi và xu hướng; ví dụ như xu hướng sống đơn giản, xu hướng ngôi nhà nhỏ, sống đơn giản tự nguyện, chủ nghĩa thu nhỏ, và tối giản. Ý tưởng cốt lõi đằng sau đó chính là chủ ý lựa chọn của bạn. Ví dụ như nếu bạn ủng hộ xu hướng ngôi nhà nhỏ, bạn không bị buộc phải sống trong một ngôi nhà nhỏ theo một kích cỡ quy định. Chuyển đến sống trong một ngôi nhà nhỏ có thể là mục tiêu dài hạn của bạn, song bạn vẫn có thể ủng hộ xu hướng trên mà không cần phải làm vậy. Sống giản dị là một triết lý sống, chứ không phải những gì bạn sở hữu.\n",

    "description": "Chúng ta đang sống trong một thế giới đầy bất trắc với những nỗi đau của nhân loại cùng sự hủy hoại nghiêm trọng của môi trường. Chính vì vậy, chúng ta cần quan tâm đến nhau nhiều hơn để góp phần giảm bớt những nỗi đau và bất trắc ấy trong cuộc sống. Thế nhưng, chúng ta sẽ thể hiện điều đó như thế nào để có thể làm vơi đi những bất hạnh của chính mình và của người khác?\nBí quyết đơn giản nhất chính là: \"Mỗi người hãy biết chia sẻ, biết cho đi, biết trao tặng những gì tốt nhất mà mình có cho người khác\". Thật vậy, cuộc sống chính là quá trình trao tặng và đón nhận không ngừng. Có rất nhiều thứ chúng ta có thể trao tặng cho người khác, từ của cải vật chất cho đến một lời khuyên, một trải nghiệm, một lời nói chân tình, hay thậm chí chỉ là một ánh mắt thiện cảm, một nụ cười đôn hậu... Những hành động chia sẻ đó thể hiện tấm lòng yêu thương của chúng ta dành cho mọi người. Và chắc chắn rằng chúng ta cũng sẽ đón nhận được không ít điều tuyệt vời bắt nguồn từ sự cho đi cao đẹp này.\nCuộc sống là quá trình trao tặng và đón nhận không ngừng, mỗi chúng ta là một mắc xích quan trọng trong vòng liên kết ấy. Vì vậy, bạn đừng do dự khi mở rộng lòng mình với mọi người. Rất nhiều người, rất nhiều nơi trên thế giới đang chờ đợi ở bạn một sự hảo tâm, một vòng tay ấm áp... Đôi khi, chỉ một ánh mắt trìu mến, một nụ cười thân thiện, hay một câu nói chân tình cũng đủ làm viên mãn một trái tim! Hãy cho đi để thấy rằng đời sống thật phong phú.\nXuất phát từ chính những trải nghiệm thực tế, đồng thời căn cứ vào kết quả của một số công trình nghiên cứu, hai tác giả đã gợi mở nhiều ý tưởng sâu sắc đáng để người đọc suy ngẫm. Ở đó chúng ta không chỉ thấy được sức mạnh của sự chia sẻ mà còn học được cách chia sẻ. Sự chia sẻ giúp ta tìm được ý nghĩa đích thực của cuộc sống, xoá bỏ trong ta những lo âu, sợ hãi và cảm giác cô đơn, lạc lõng giữa dòng đời. Hơn thế nữa, ta nghiệm ra rằng: cho và nhận đều mang đến hạnh phúc. Cho không có nghĩa là mất đi, mà đó là lúc chúng ra được nhận lại rất nhiều - dưới muôn vàn hình thức khác nhau.\n",

    "description": "Khát vọng và ý chí tuyệt vời của một em bé trong tận cùng của sự hắt hủi và vùi dập\nKhông nơi nương tựa là câu chuyện thật của chính tác giả, kể về thời thơ ấu bị vùi dập đau thương của mình - một trong những trường hợp hắt hủi và bạo hành trẻ em nghiêm trọng nhất lịch sử bang California, Hoa Kỳ. Em bé Dave Pelzer đã bị chính mẹ ruột bỏ đói và đánh đập tàn nhẫn. Người mẹ luôn bày ra những trò không thể đoán trước được, ác độc và gây nguy hiểm đến tính mạng của cậu. Dave phải học cách đối phó với những ngón đòn của người mẹ ruột của chính mình để sống sót vì bà ta đã không còn coi cậu là con trai của mình, mà chỉ là một tên nô lệ; trong mắt bà ta, Dave không phải là một đứa bé, mà là một \"con vật\".\nChỗ ngủ của Dave là một chiếc cũi nhỏ và cũ kỹ đặt dưới tầng hầm, còn quần áo của cậu thì rách nát và luôn bốc mùi nồng nặc. Cậu chỉ được mẹ quẳng cho những mẫu thức ăn dư thừa, ôi thiu. Thế giới bên ngoài không hay biết gì về những cơn ác mộng có thật của cậu bé đáng thương ấy. Cậu không có bất kỳ ai để nương tựa, chỉ có những giấc mơ dẫn đường cho cậu tiếp tục sống - giấc mơ về một người nào đó quan tâm đến cậu, yêu thương cậu và gọi cậu là con.\nQua mỗi cuộc chống chọi của cậu bé ấy trong bóng tối cay nghiệt, bạn sẽ thấy như bản thân mình cũng cảm nhận được nỗi đau của cậu, an ủi mỗi cô đơn của cậu và cùng cậu tranh đấu cho sự sống còn. Câu chuyện đầy sức thuyết phục này sẽ giúp chúng ta nhận định rõ hơn về bản chất của nạn bạo hành trẻ em, đồng thời biết rằng chúng ta hoàn toàn có khả năng tạo nên một điều gì đó khác biệt để chấm dứt thực trạng đau lòng này.\nDave Pelzer được xem là một trong những phát ngôn viên quốc gia làm việc hiệu quả nhất và đáng tin cậy nhất, chuyên hoạt động trong các nhóm hội, tổ chức chuyên nghiệp về dịch vụ nhân quyền. Những thành tích nổi bật của Dave đã nhận được những lời khen tặng từ đích thân cựu Tổng thống Ronald Reagan và George Bussh. Năm 1993, Dave được vinh danh là một trong mười Đại diện tiêu biểu nhất của Thanh niên Hoa Kỳ và năm 1994, Dave là công dân duy nhất của nước Mỹ vinh dự được trao tặng giải thưởng Thanh niên tiêu biểu nhất của thế giới. Dave còn được chọn làm người rước đuốc trong Thế Vận Hội năm 1996. Dave đã cống hiến cả cuộc đời mình để giúp nhiều người khác thoát khỏi nghịch cảnh.\nNhận định\n\"A child called ‘It'\" là câu chuyện thật sự cảm động và thu hút, đến nỗi tôi lẫn các đồng sự đều không thể kiềm lòng. Câu chuyện của Dave Pelzer không nhằm mục đích nhấn mạnh hoàn cảnh khó khăn, tăm tối trong quá khứ mà nhằm nói lên ý chí cao độ của anh, đó cũng chính là điều đã làm lay động trái tim của tất cả chúng ta. Dave là một minh chứng sống cho việc tất cả chúng ta đều có khả năng làm cho cuộc đời của chính mình tốt đẹp hơn dù có gặp phải những khó khăn, trắc trở thế nào đi nữa.\n(Jack canfield - Đồng tác giả Chicken Soup for the Soul)\n",

Dù mỗi người có một ách ứng phó khác nhau nhưng chắc chắn có điều khác biệt khá lớn giữa một người có niềm tin và một người phó mặc đời mình cho số phận. Trong khó khăn, nếu bạn không có niềm tin, đổ lỗi cho người khác, đổ lỗi cho hoàn cảnh hay tự cho mình là một người kém may mắn, thì bạn chỉ càng làm cho mình đuối sức, bế tắc, vất vả hơn.

Một khi bạn sống mà không có niềm tin về bản thân, về con người và cuộc sống thì bạn thì bạn sẽ mãi còn ngụp lặn trong những suy nghĩ tiêu cực, sẽ lãng phí những khoảnh khắc đầy ý nghĩa của cuộc sống - một cuộc sống mà bạn vốn có thể làm được rất nhiều những điều mình hằng mơ ước.\nĐiểm tựa của niềm tin gồm những câu chuyện ý nghĩa về nghị lực vượt lên thử thách, về niềm tin của con người đối với bản thân và những điều tốt đẹp của cuộc sống.\nQua từng câu chuyện, chúng ta sẽ nhận ra rằng - một khi có niềm tin - tất cả mọi người điều có khả năng vượt qua khó khăn , nghịch cảnh của cuộc sống.

    "description": "Chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra khi hệ miễn dịch của cơ thể ta ngừng hoạt động?\nHãy thử tưởng tượng bạn sống trong thế giới ngày nay mà không có hệ miễn dịch… Đây chính xác là cách mà bệnh nhân HIV tử vong. Người bị bệnh HIV không chết vì vi khuẩn HIV mà bởi các bệnh khác. Vi khuẩn HIV có nhiệm vụ phá hủy hệ miễn dịch của cơ thể ta và do vậy, một căn bệnh nhỏ như cảm cúm lúc này... cũng có thể gây tử vong.\nHệ miễn dịch là một thành phần KHÔNG THỂ THIẾU cho cơ thể, nhưng bạn có biết tâm hồn cũng có “hệ miễn dịch”? Giống như cơ thể tâm hồn cũng có thể mắc bệnh và do vậy cũng cần một hệ miễn dịch mạnh mẽ.\nPhần lớn chúng ta mất đi sự cân bằng trong cuộc sống, thường hay chán nản, buồn bực, đau khổ, stress… là bởi hệ miễn dịch tâm hồn đã trở nên quá yếu. Chúng ta thường xuyên cho tâm hồn ăn những thức ăn “ôi thiêu” và có hại là những suy nghĩ lãng phí và tiêu cực. Chúng ta hiếm khi dành thời gian cho bản thân để hiểu rõ tâm hồn nhưng lại dành quá nhiều thời gian để chăm sóc cơ thể. Một tâm hồn yếu đuối không thể đưa ra những quyết định đúng đắn. Một tâm hồn yếu đuối không thể hài lòng và mãn nguyện cho dù cơ thể ta có khỏe mạnh, tài chính ta có mạnh mẽ.\nQuyển sách nhỏ “Hệ miễn dịch Tâm Hồn” của Mike George ra đời với mục đích giúp ta tìm hiểu thêm một chút về bản chất tự nhiên của một tâm hồn mạnh mẽ và những điều khiến ta hủy hoại nó, một số biện pháp đo lường xem ta vững mạnh đến mức độ nào và sau cùng là cách tăng cường khả năng miễn dịch cho tâm hồn nhằm khôi phục và duy trì sự mạnh mẽ nội tâm.\nNhững suy ngẫm trong quyển sách sẽ vạch rõ những niềm tin thông thường nhất và nguy hại nhất đã khiến ta đau khổ.\nChỉ khi ta hiểu ra chân tướng sự việc, thì sự thật mới giải phóng ta khỏi nỗi khổ đau.\n",

    "description": "Cuộc sống như một dòng sông chảy xiết, đe dọa cuốn trôi và vùi lấp tất cả. Thế nhưng, chúng ta không thể cứ bám vào bờ sông để tìm sự chắc chắn, vì sự bám víu do sợ hãi sẽ là chướng ngại không cho chúng ta có được một cuộc sống đầy đủ và trọn vẹn. Các giáo lý trình bày trong sách - gọi là Ba Hạnh Nguyện - giải thích vì sao chúng ta phải bước hẳn vào trong dòng sông, sẵn sàng hiện diện trước mọi thời điểm khó khăn và những tình huống gay go nhất. Khi biết từ bỏ những cung cách tự vệ quen thuộc, chúng ta sẽ thấy cuộc sống tốt đẹp hơn và đáng sống hơn rất nhiều, và từ đó có thể tìm thấy hạnh phúc cho chính mình và cho những người khác.\nPema Chodron đưa ra những hướng dẫn thiết thực về cách sống lạc quan và hữu ích trong một thế giới đầy bấp bênh và hụt hẫng, kèm theo là những ví dụ cụ thể và xác đáng. Đây là những bài học quan trọng được rút ra từ các truyền thống tôn giáo phương Đông, nhất là từ Phật giáo Tây Tạng.\n",

    "description": "Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King, Margaret Thatcher… là những chính trị gia nổi tiếng trên thế giới. Họ được đông đảo công chúng biết tới vì những gì họ đã làm cho đất nước, cho lý tưởng họ theo đuổi hay những thành công trong sự nghiệp. Để thành công, họ không chỉ cần tài năng mà cần thành thạo những kĩ năng cần thiết của một nhà lãnh đạo. Một trong số đó là nghệ thuật diễn thuyết trước công chúng. Cuốn sách mỏng của Giáo sư về Ngôn ngữ và Lãnh đạo tại Đại học Nam Colorado, James C. Humes, người từng soạn các bài diễn văn cho năm vị Tổng thống của nước Mỹ, là tập hợp 21 kĩ năng trong nghệ thuật diễn thuyết, bao gồm nghệ thuật tạm dừng trước khi phát biểu, nghệ thuật nói lời mở đầu, nghệ thuật thể hiện phong thái, nghệ thuật thể hiện thông điệp… với nhiều câu chuyện minh họa thực tế, sinh động từ các diễn giả lừng danh trên thế giới.\nDemosthenes, vị diễn giả nổi tiếng nhất thành Athens, khi được hỏi đâu là ba thử thách dành cho một diễn giả vĩ đại đã trả lời rằng: “Hành động, hành động và hành động!”. Winston Churchill, chính trị giả nổi tiếng với vai trò Thủ tướng Anh, là một “chú Sư tử” mạnh mẽ. Khi nước Anh kiệt quệ do chiến tranh, ông đã biến ngôn từ của mình thành vũ khí và làm Đức quốc xã khiếp sợ, khiến chúng chùn bước không dám xâm chiếm Anh quốc. Chiếc kính gọng đen nặng mà ông đeo khi đọc diễn văn, điếu xì gà ve vẩy trên tay trái và ngón tay đặt hình chữ “V chiến thắng” được giơ lên bằng tay phải là những dấu hiệu mang tính chính trị rõ nét. Abraham Lincoln, vị Tổng thống thứ 16 của Hoa Kỳ, nổi tiếng với bài diễn văn Gettysburg chỉ dài hai phút, không hề đọc bài phát biểu viết sẵn, thậm chí cũng không hề nhìn vào tờ giấy. Ông tập trung vào khán giả và nói chuyện trực tiếp với họ, như thể những lời nói đó được lấy ra từ trái tim mình.\nCùng với Benjamin Franklin, một trong những người thành lập đất nước nổi tiếng của Hoa Kỳ và Ronald Reagan, vị Tổng thống thứ 40 của Hoa Kỳ, họ đều là những bậc thầy về kể chuyện. Martin Luther King, một trong những nhà lãnh đạo có ảnh hưởng lớn nhất trong lịch sử Hoa Kỳ cũng như lịch sử đương đại của phong trào bất bạo động, người đoạt giải Nobel Hòa bình năm 1964, người da màu trong thế giới da trắng của người Mỹ, đã tìm ra cách để được lắng nghe. Ông nổi tiếng với các bài phát biểu đậm chất thơ, nắm vững nghệ thuật nói lời kết cho các bài phát biểu… Napoleon, một trong những nhân vật có sức ảnh hưởng lớn trong lịch sử thế giới, bởi ngoài những ưu thế khác thì ông còn rất biết cách tạo sức thu hút đối với mọi người. Giống như Juarez, luật sư và chính trị gia của Mexico sống vào thế kỷ XIX, Napoleon không có lợi thế về dáng người, và khi truyền đạt với quân đội Pháp, ông nói bằng giọng đặc tiếng Ý của đảo Corse, hòn đảo nơi ông sinh ra. Nhưng ông thường đứng yên lặng trong khoảng 40 đến 50 giây trước khi phát biểu. Như thể cứ mỗi giây ông chờ đợi thì trong mắt binh lính ông lại cao thêm 1cm. Nhà quân sự -­­ chính trị này đã sử dụng nghệ thuật tạm dừng trước khi phát biểu như chiếc chìa khóa nâng cao tầm quan trọng cho thông điệp của mình.\nCho dù họ là chính khách, nhà quân sự, diễn giả lừng danh hay nhà hoạt động xã hội… thì không phải tất cả những cá nhân đó đã vĩ đại ngay từ lúc sinh ra. Họ đều là những người nghệ sĩ không ngừng mài giũa các kỹ năng thuyết trình để củng cố thông điệp. Họ đều sở hữu những bí mật diễn thuyết tuyệt vời để thành công trong vai trò lãnh đạo, vượt qua nhiều rào cản chính trị và kêu gọi được sự ủng hộ đông đảo của công chúng.\n",

    "description": "Từ trước tới nay, ai cũng dùng cuốn sổ tay chỉ để ghi chép công việc - và chỉ đơn thuần là như vậy. Theo đề nghị của bạn đọc từ nhiều năm nay muốn có và được lưu giữ một cuốn sổ vừa ghi chép, vừa là một người bạn tinh thần chia sẻ, động viên và truyền cảm hứng vào những thời điểm khó khăn của cuộc sống, nhân kỷ niệm 20 năm thành lập, First News đã thiết kế và ra mắt ấn bản đặc biệt Aniversary Special Edition song ngữ Anh - Việt mang tên Sổ Tay Truyền Cảm Hứng - Hạt Giống Tâm Hồn.\nCuốn sổ được thiết kế đơn giản nhưng trang nhã, chất giấy mịn, có dòng kẻ, màu giấy tươi sáng. Những câu nói hay, ý nghĩa của những người thông thái, nổi tiếng trên thế giới, hình ảnh tác giả được trình bày xen kẽ với những câu chuyện “Súp Gà Cho Tâm Hồn” ý nghĩa và lịch ghi chép 2015. Câu danh ngôn được trích dẫn nguyên bản và chụp lại trên những bức tường đường phố, trên ghế đá công viên, trên thành xe buýt, trên vách đá ở khắp nơi trên thế giới… hay được viết, khắc nguệch ngoạc không biết từ bao giờ bởi những người vô danh nhưng có thể làm lay động lòng người.\nKhi bạn gặp một biến cố hay nỗi đau buồn, bạn không thể không mỉm cười và có góc nhìn lạc quan hơn khi đọc câu nói dí dỏm và “thấm đời” của danh hài Charlie Chaplin: “Tôi có rất nhiều vấn đề và nỗi buồn trong cuộc đời, nhưng đôi môi của tôi không hề biết. Chúng luôn cười”. Hay câu nói lừng danh của của nhà triết học, nhà thơ Oscar Wilde từ thế kỷ thứ 18: “Đừng khóc cho những gì đã mất. Hãy cười vì những gì còn lại”. “Khi cuộc đời cho bạn hàng trăm lý do để khóc, hãy tìm từ cuộc sống hàng nghìn lý do để cười”.\nHay vào những lúc cân nhắc, suy tư, chiêm nghiệm sự được mất, bại thành, hay quyết định làm một điều gì đó, bạn sẽ tìm thấy sự chia sẻ sâu sắc của George Horace Lorimer: “Có tiền và những thứ mua được bằng tiền là điều rất tốt, nhưng thỉnh thoảng bạn hãy kiểm tra lại xem bạn có mất đi những thứ mà tiền không thể mua được không”. Và câu chia sẻ chân tình của Steve Jobs: “Làm người giàu có nhất trong nghĩa trang chẳng có nghĩa lý gì, chết chẳng ai mang theo được gì hết - nên hãy sống rộng mở”. Bạn cũng sẽ hiểu quan điểm sống thú vị của bà Michelle Obama, phu nhân đương kim Tổng thống Hoa Kỳ Barack Obama: “Thành công không phải là bạn kiếm được bao nhiêu tiền - mà là sự khác biệt bạn tạo nên cho cuộc sống của những người khác” hay cha đẻ của thuyết tương đối Albert Einstein:“Đừng cố gắng trở thành một người thành công, mà tốt hơn, hãy cố gắng trở thành  một người có giá trị\". Bạn sẽ gặp lại tác giả phiêu bạt lừng danh Jack London về sự khắc nghiệt của cuộc sống qua tác phẩm nổi tiếng “Tiếng gọi nơi hoang dã” và “Tình yêu Cuộc sống” với câu nói trực diện, thẳng thắn khiến bạn không thể không giật mình, suy ngẫm: “Cho con chó một cục xương thì không phải là từ thiện. Từ thiện là một cục xương chia sẻ với con chó khi bạn cũng đang đói như một con chó”.\nTrong một thế giới đầy biến động và thay trắng đổi đen từng ngày như hiện nay, bạn sẽ rất tâm đắc với câu nói của nhà bác học Albert Einstein: “Thế giới sẽ không bị hủy hoại bởi những kẻ làm điều ác, mà sẽ bị tàn phá bởi những kẻ thấy điều ác đó mà dửng dưng không làm gì cả\". Bạn cũng sẽ tìm ra giải pháp trong những trường hợp lựa chọn tình yêu thương của cuộc sống với câu nói của người dành cả cuộc đời đấu tranh chống chủ nghĩa phân biệt chủng tộc Martin Luther King: “Bóng tối không thể đẩy lùi được bóng tối; Chỉ có ánh sáng mới có thể. Lòng thù hận không thể hóa giải được thù hận; Chỉ có tình yêu thương mới hóa giải được”. Hay câu nói bất hủ của Mẹ Teresa: “Ngay cả những người giàu có cũng đói khát tình yêu thương, họ cũng mong muốn được chăm sóc, mong muốn được tìm kiếm, và mong muốn có được ai đó của riêng mình”.\nNếu bạn đang là người cầm bút, kiên định với cách sống của mình và có những lúc lung lay niềm tin, tinh thần bạn sẽ rộng mở, mạnh mẽ hơn khi đọc được câu thú vị của Harley Davidson: “Khi viết câu chuyện của cuộc đời bạn, đừng để ai giữ ngòi bút”, hay câu nói thể hiện cá tính khác biệt của Lý Tiểu Long; “Tôi không bước vào thế giới này để sống theo kỳ vọng của các bạn, và bạn cũng không bước vào thế giới này để sống theo kỳ vọng của tôi”, hay nhận định của nhà triết học Milton Friedman: “Ai đi nhanh nhất - người đó sẽ đi một mình trong cô đơn”.\nAi đó đang đối diện với những khó khăn, thử thách, nghịch cảnh sẽ tâm đắc với câu nói nổi tiếng của Helen Keller: “Cuộc sống là chấp nhận mạo hiểm hoặc là không có gì hết”, hay câu nói của Che Guevara, nhà cách mạng lỗi lạc người Achentina: “Nếu bạn tìm ra con đường mà không hề có trở ngại nào hết, thì nó sẽ chẳng dẫn bạn đi tới đâu” hoặc tâm sự của Nelson Meldela: “Người dũng cảm không phải không cảm nhận sự sợ hãi - nhưng biết chế ngự và vượt qua nó.” hoặc câu nói của Barack Obama: “Chúng ta đến với thế giới này không phải để sợ hãi về tương lai. Chúng ta tới đây để sắp xếp nó lại”, Hay triết lý sống của Bruce Lee - Lý Tiểu Long: “Nếu bạn luôn đặt giới hạn cho mọi thứ bạn làm, từ thể chất cho đến bất kỳ điều gì khác, nó sẽ lây nhiễm vào công việc và cuộc sống của bạn. Không hề có giới hạn nào hết. Có chăng chỉ là những mức độ đạt được, và bạn không được chễm chệ ở đó mãi. Bạn phải vượt lên chúng”, hẳn bạn sẽ được tiếp thêm động lực và sức mạnh tinh thần.\nĐiều thú vị là các danh ngôn, câu nói được áp dụng thủ pháp chơi chữ, ngắn gọn và rất giản dị, tạo sự khám phá bất ngờ cho người đọc, dễ nhớ và gần gũi, chẳng hạn như:\n“Mục đích cuộc sống là sống có mục đích - Purpose of life is a life of purpose - Robert Byrne”\n“Tính cách có thể mở được cánh cửa, nhưng chỉ có nhân cách mới mở rộng được cánh cửa dài lâu - Personlality can open the doors, but the Character can keep them open - Elmer G. Letterman”\n“Ý nghĩa cuộc sống là đi tìm món quà cho bạn. Mục đích của cuộc sống là trao tặng món quà nó đi”\n“Có một triệu người bạn chưa phải là một điều diệu kỳ. Điều diệu kỳ chính là có một người bạn luôn ở bên bạn khi có hàng triệu người chống lại bạn”; “Khi thực hành sự tha thứ, kẻ thù của người đó chính là người thầy tốt nhất” - Dalai Lama..\nVà hàng trăm câu danh ngôn thú vị, độc đáo khác của những người nổi tiếng cùng những câu chuyện Hạt Giống Tâm Hồn hay nhất được chọn lọc trong cuốn sổ này sẽ đưa bạn đến một thế giới rộng mở với những chân lý, giá trị vĩnh hằng mà bạn đã từng được biết, được nghe đến đâu đó vào những giai đoạn hạnh phúc, bình yên nhất của cuộc sống; Hy vọng đây sẽ là điểm tựa tinh thần cho bạn ở hiện tại và tương lai.\n",

    "description": "Tại sao những người giỏi nhất, sáng sủa nhất trong mọi độ tuổi và mọi nghề nghiệp đều phải vật lộn, một hiện tượng chưa từng thấy trước đây? Hay quan trọng hơn, bạn có thể làm gì nếu bạn là một nhà chuyên môn tham vọng? Làm thế nào để thoát khỏi “bệnh dịch” này và hành động hiệu quả hơn, đạt thành công hơn, và cảm thấy viên mãn hơn?\nNgày nay, cá nhân lẫn tổ chức đều phải đối mặt với nguy cơ từ nhiều phía. Nền kinh tế bất ổn, tác động của công nghệ mới, sự thay đổi bộ mặt và văn hóa của tổ chức, các thách thức ngày càng tăng cho gia đình, nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với thời gian và nguồn lực của chúng ta - tất cả những thứ này làm tăng thêm sự căng thẳng lo lắng của mọi người. Nhà chuyên môn tham vọng phản ứng càng mạnh mẽ hơn trước những nguy cơ này. Chúng ta bị thuyết phục rằng mình không còn được sếp ưu ái, rằng công việc kinh doanh của chúng ta sẽ thất bại, rằng chúng ta sẽ bị bỏ qua khi xét thăng chức, rằng chúng ta sẽ bị loại khi cần thu hẹp quy mô, rằng chúng ta sẽ thành nhóm hạng B trong khi chúng ta vẫn nghĩ mình là nhân viên hạng A.\nTrong môi trường bất ổn và khó tiên đoán này, ngay cả những người sáng chói nhất cũng phải lo ngại. Để phản ứng lại những lo ngại đó, chúng ta cố thủ, ngăn cản bản thân không dám chấp nhận những thách thức mới. Chúng ta bị bó hẹp trong những việc thường ngày, tập trung vào những nhiệm vụ chúng ta đã làm tốt và bỏ qua những thử thách hay cơ hội có thể mở rộng năng lực cho mình. Chúng ta biết phản ứng này làm hại bản thân và tổ chức. Nhưng chúng ta sợ phải tổn thương thêm nữa nếu phạm sai lầm khi học hỏi điều mới hay thử nghiệm cách tiếp cận mới.\nTổ chức không thiếu những người thông minh, tham vọng, nhưng lại không hoạt động hết công suất và không cảm thấy thỏa mãn với bản thân. Bác sĩ, luật sư, giáo viên, kỹ sư, và lãnh đạo công ty hay các nhà quản lý nhận thấy họ không thể đạt những mục tiêu đề ra hay tìm thấy ý nghĩa trong công việc. Tuy nhiên, một số những nhà chuyên môn tham vọng này vượt qua được nỗi sợ, tiếp thu hành vi mới, và dẫn đến một cuộc đời viên mãn, cực kỳ thành công. Đáng buồn thay, họ chỉ là thiểu số.\nGiáo sư Thomas DeLong tại Trường Kinh doanh Harvard, tác giả cuốn sách Tung cánh tự do cho biết, chúng ta phải học cách tung cánh không có lưới bảo vệ. Nói cách khác, chúng ta cần tìm cách vượt qua các lo ngại đang ngăn trở bản thân hành động; dần dần tin tưởng vào khả năng học hỏi, phát triển, và thay đổi; và nhận ra rằng khả năng này sẽ giúp cá nhân rất nhiều trong nghề nghiệp. Tung cánh một cách tự tin không diễn ra chỉ sau một đêm. Đây là một quá trình, bắt đầu từ việc nhận thức được các thế lực tác động làm tăng sự lo ngại, tạo cạm bẫy, và khích cá nhân hướng đến những hành vi thiếu hiệu quả nhằm trấn an bản thân. Quá trình này cũng đòi hỏi cá nhân phải chấp nhận một số phương pháp đi ngược trực giác để có can đảm làm chưa tốt việc đáng làm trước khi có thể làm thật tốt việc đáng làm. Và đây là một quá trình đòi hỏi mỗi người phải chịu tổn thương, một điều mà không nhà chuyên môn tham vọng nào muốn. Tuy nhiên, để thành công hơn và cảm thấy thỏa mãn hơn với công việc, cá nhân phải sẵn sàng mở lòng để học hỏi và trải nghiệm cái mới, nhẹ nhất là thấy bất an, hay tệ hơn, cá nhân sẽ thấy mình thiếu năng lực. Những cảm xúc này mang tính tạm thời và là bước đệm dẫn đến một cuộc đời và sự nghiệp sâu sắc và rộng mở hơn.\nThomas Delong giải thích cách tích lũy sức mạnh từ tổn thương. Bước đầu tiên là tìm hiểu các yếu tố gây áp lực làm tăng thêm lo lắng trong lòng người thành đạt và gây ra hành vi phản tác dụng. Thứ hai, chúng ta phải tiếp thu cách làm cho chúng ta đủ can đảm “làm không tốt điều đáng làm” trước khi chúng ta có thể “làm tốt điều đáng làm”.\nDựa vào những nghiên cứu nghiêm túc và quá trình công tác tư vấn, DeLong đã trình bày:\n- Nguyên nhân nỗi lo sợ của người thành đạt: lo sợ sai lầm, thiếu ý nghĩa mục đích, và khao khát kết nối con người.\n- Hành vi gây hại mà chúng ta áp dụng để trốn thoát lo ngại: bận rộn, so sánh bản thân với người khác, và đổ lỗi cho người khác về bực dọc của mình.\n- Hành vi chúng ta cần thể hiện để tích lũy sức mạnh từ tổn thương: Bỏ lại quá khứ sau lưng và tìm kiếm phản hồi trung thực.\nVới những lời khuyên thiết thực và những câu chuyện truyền cảm hứng, Tung cánh tự do là một nguồn lực quý giá dành cho nhà lãnh đạo mong muốn vươn lên trong thời đại lo lắng hiện nay.\n",

Tuy nhiên, vì nhiều lý do, đôi khi bạn may mắn thành công trong nhiều mối quan hệ chằng chịt của xã hội, nhưng lắm khi, hoàn toàn một cách tự nhiên, bạn trở nên vụng về, vô tình để lại ấn tượng không tốt với đối tượng giao tiếp. Đơn giản chỉ vì bạn trót đưa ra một lời nói, một cử chỉ không phù hợp; hoặc do bạn không \"bắt được đúng tần số\" mà người khác đang muốn liên lạc với bạn.\nCuốn sách Giải Mã Sức Hút Cá Nhân chỉ ra rằng, sức hút cá nhân không phải hoàn toàn do bẩm sinh mà tùy vào việc cá nhân trong xã hội tạo dựng mối quan hệ giữa bản thân với người khác như thế nào.\nVới văn phong súc tích, giàu hình ảnh và dồi dào tư liệu, dẫn chứng cụ thể, rút tỉa từ kinh nghiệm của nhiều bậc danh nhân, tác giả Andrew Leigh cố gắng tổng hợp khá đầy đủ các yếu tố giúp một người có thể phát huy năng lực giao tiếp của bản thân.Tác giả cuốn sách quy các yếu tố này thành phương pháp có tên gọi là A-B-C, một phương pháp mà theo ông hiệu quả cho người học tự trau dồi để mang lại nét hấp dẫn từ trong ngoại hình, cảm xúc và trí tuệ.\n",

Bạn càng làm cho người khác cảm thấy họ quan trọng thì họ sẽ càng có phản ứng tích cực đối với bạn. Tất cả chúng ta đều ngưỡng mộ những người dường như có khả năng kết thân với người lạ chỉ qua một lần trò chuyện và thường gọi họ là \"những người có sức hút\". Nhưng đa phần chúng ta lại cho rằng đây là năng khiếu bẩm sinh. Thật ra, sức thu hút của họ chính là kỹ năng tạo ấn tượng với người khác. Bạn hoàn toàn có thể học hỏi, phát triển và hoàn thiện kỹ năng này nếu bạn tích lũy được những hiểu biết nhất định và có quyết tâm. Những kỹ năng dành cho cuộc sống sẽ cung cấp những kỹ năng cần thiết giúp bạn tạo ấn tượng với mọi người trong bất kỳ tình huống nào và đạt được thành công vượt bậc trong giao tiếp. Khi vận dụng các kỹ năng này vào cuộc sống, bạn đừng ngạc nhiên nếu ai đó hỏi rằng: \"Làm thế nào bạn có thể nói chuyện lôi cuốn đến vậy?\".

Rồi người ấy tập hợp các bài kệ này dưới những chủ đề khác nhau, cũng như hoa nhài để riêng, hoa huệ để riêng, hoa vạn thọ để riêng. Người ấy bỏ những bài kệ mà nghĩa lý còn mù mờ, chỉ chọn những bài kệ nghĩa lý thật sáng 3 tỏ, cũng như cầm hoa mà rũ, làm rơi rụng những cánh hoa không còn tươi thắm, để chỉ còn những đóa hoa thật tươi, trước khi xâu kết thành tràng hoa.\n",

    "description": "Cuốn sách như một hành trang giản dị mở lối thành công cho những sinh viên và người trẻ có khát vọng hoàn thiện bản thân.\n\"Cuốn sách này được viết lên dưới ánh sáng tinh thần của câu châm ngôn “Giá trị tri thức nằm ở sự chia sẻ”, và quan điểm của nhà thông thái Goethe (J.W.Gớt): “Chúng ta phải tiếp thu và học tập ở những người đi trước chúng ta và cả những người đồng thời với ta. Ngay cả thiên tài cực kì vĩ đại cũng không thể tiến xa được nếu chỉ muốn lấy mọi thứ từ thế giới nội tâm của riêng mình”. Do vậy, mong bạn hãy đọc và cảm nhận cuốn sách này trong tâm thế của một người trẻ, tuổi trẻ hoặc tâm hồn trẻ và hướng đến giá trị sẻ chia đích thực.\nHai lăm tuổi, tôi tự nhận mình chưa ở đỉnh cao của công việc cũng như sự nghiệp để truyền đạt kinh nghiệm hay chia sẻ bí quyết cho người khác. Nhưng tôi hiểu, ở mỗi giai đoạn của cuộc đời, người ta sẽ có Thế Giới Quan khác nhau về đời và về người để sẻ chia và tìm kiếm sự thấu hiểu. Lăng kính tri thức ở tuổi hai lăm của tôi, là sự góp nhặt của những năm tháng miệt mài trên ghế nhà trường, là sự trải nghiệm của rất nhiều những thời khắc quan trọng trong quá khứ, là sự lĩnh hội và thức tỉnh từ những giá trị về Chân - Thiện - Mỹ của cuộc sống hiện tại, mà trong dòng đời nhiều xô đẩy này, tôi học được.\nBạn biết không, rất nhiều người dù đã ra trường nhưng luôn nuối tiếc quãng thời gian tuổi trẻ, và họ luôn mong mỏi ước gì được quay lại giảng đường, họ sẽ sống tốt hơn, sẽ biết mình là ai sớm hơn và phải sống thế nào, nên đi về đâu. Bởi đơn giản rằng, thời sinh viên họ đã sống, chỉ vì “phải sống, phải tốt nghiệp đại học” mà không biết những giá trị khác khiến họ đánh mất quá nhiều thứ. Bản thân tác giả trước đây cũng thế. Nhìn lại, bạn bè cùng lứa hay những thế hệ sinh viên sau này, có quá nhiều người giống mình lúc đó! Họ đang không được chia sẻ theo cách mà họ cần được biết để có một tuổi xuân không nhạt, một thời sinh viên đáng nhớ. Vì vậy, tôi luôn ấp ủ một lúc nào đó có thể sẻ chia những điều tôi học được, và cuốn sách này ra đời. Hy vọng, cuốn sách có thể giúp sinh viên và những người trẻ bước thêm một bước dài trên con đường hoàn thiện bản thân. Để không còn những tiếc nuối của ngày mai kia - khi thời gian đã đi xa mãi.\nNếu bạn cảm thấy những điều tôi chia sẻ là phù hợp với mình, hãy xem đó như những viên gạch nền mà bạn sẽ dùng để xây nên nhân cách và cuộc sống của chính bạn. Có thể, nhiều phần trong cuốn sách sẽ làm bạn phật ý hoặc cho rằng tác giả nói khá nặng nề, nhưng hãy hiểu rằng tôi không có ý dạy dỗ, chỉ trích hoặc chê bai sinh viên hay người trẻ, mà tôi chỉ sẻ chia sự thật để người trẻ hiểu hơn về chính họ, từ đó thay đổi hành động bản thân. Bởi lẽ nuông chiều theo cảm xúc bạn đọc hay khen ngợi thì dễ, nhưng để người trẻ thấy mình còn thiếu sót nhiều thứ thì mới là điều khó khăn hơn và sẽ hữu ích hơn gấp nhiều lần.\nCuộc sống sẽ đẹp biết bao, khi không chỉ tôi, mà rất nhiều những người trẻ khác, cùng nhau viết nên những trải nghiệm và sẻ chia kiến thức của mình cho những người xung quanh. Đâu đó, vẫn còn rất nhiều những tài năng thu mình với kho tàng tri thức mà họ đã tích luỹ.\nCuối cùng, xin được xưng hô “tác giả” và/hoặc “tôi” để chỉ bản thân người viết và “bạn” để gọi tên độc giả với tất cả sự trân trọng. Chúng ta cùng một dòng máu Việt Nam tóc đen da vàng và cùng một thế hệ trẻ sống dưới bầu trời tự do, bình đẳng. Ghế giảng đường dù cũ, dù mới, nhưng là nơi tri thức được ươm mầm để chắp cánh tới tương lai. Hãy quý trọng thời gian chúng ta ngồi trên chiếc ghế mà chúng ta từng muốn, thay vì nghĩ tới thời gian chúng ta rời khỏi vị trí đó.\nThành tâm chúc bạn sẽ tìm thấy những điều thú vị cho chính mình khi phải bỏ tiền bạc và thời gian quý báu để đọc những điều tôi viết.\"\n(Đậu Thị Quyên)\n\n",

    "description": "Cuộc sống là một vở kịch và nhân vật chính là chúng ta. Bản thân mỗi chúng ta phải diễn vai trong chính vở kịch ấy. Vậy câu hỏi đặt ra cho chúng ta là phải vẽ nên một vở kịch trong suốt cuộc đời mình như thế nào? Cũng có người nói rằng số mệnh của con người đã được quyết định ngay từ lúc mới được sinh ra. Nhưng tôi tin rằng nếu chúng ta luôn nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn và nâng cao tinh thần của bản thân thì chúng ta có thể làm thay đổi vận mệnh của chính mình. Thay vì tìm cách thay đổi vận mệnh, chúng ta hãy tìm cách nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn của chính mình. Khi có tâm hồn rộng mở, cuộc sống của bạn sẽ thay đổi.\nTrong lời nói đầu, tác giả viết:\n“Khi ta còn nhỏ, hễ chúng ta bị thầy cô, cha mẹ hay cấp trên la rầy, dạy bảo điều gì thì chúng ta thường phản ứng lại. Tôi cũng vậy. Cho dù cha mẹ nói với tôi. “Hãy mua những khó khăn khi còn trẻ” nhưng điều đó không lọt hề lọt vào tai tôi. Khi đó ngay lập tức tôi đã phản ứng lại “Những khó khăn khi còn trẻ thì sao không bán nó đi”.\nĐến độ tuổi trưởng thành thì cái tinh thần phản kháng ấy vẫn còn rất mạnh mẽ do vậy tôi cũng đã không để ý đến điều đó. Nhưng những điều được nhắc nhở về ý nghĩa cuộc sống từ những người lớn tuổi đầy tiên là cha mẹ đã in sâu trong đầu tôi và tôi không thể nào quên.Khi mới bắt đầu bước đi trên con đường ý nghĩa cuộc sống của bản thân mình tôi đã gặp rất nhiều khó khăn y hệt như ra biển lớn mà không có hải đồ. Khi đó tôi chợt nhớ đến những điều mà những bậc “tiền bối” đã dạy và coi đó như là la bàn chỉ phương hướng cho mình.Những điều mà tôi viết ở cuốn sách này cũng giống như vậy. Trong số những các bạn trẻ chắc có một số bạn cũng có kí ức về sự phản ứng, không thích… như tôi khi đó. Nhưng mà tôi hy vọng khi gặp những khó khăn trên con đường lập nghiệp hoặc tạo tương lai cho cuộc sống thì các bạn hãy nhớ đến những lời khuyên chân thành mà tôi đã ghi ra ở đây. Tất cả đều là những kinh nghiệm, bài học sâu sắc mà tôi đã học được qua những trải nghiệm từ những khó khăn trong công việc cho đến những khổ đau trong cuộc sống.

    "description": "Có rất nhiều việc muốn làm… nhưng lại có quá ít thời gian”.\nĐó là chuyện thường thấy của cuộc sống hiện đại. Hãy dành một chút thời gian để xem có bao nhiêu việc bạn muốn học cách làm. Danh sách của bạn có những việc gì? Điều gì ngăn cản bạn bắt đầu? Thường là do: Thời gian và kỹ năng. Có một sự thật không lấy gì làm dễ chịu, đó là: Những trải nghiệm đáng giá nhất trong đời thường lại đòi hỏi phải có kỹ năng ở một cấp độ nào đó. Cần phải có thời gian và cần phải nỗ lực mới có được kỹ năng - mà thời gian thì chúng ta không có, còn nỗ lực lại là thứ chúng ta ngại gom góp.\n“Một ngày nào đó tôi sẽ học, khi tôi có thời gian”.\nThành thật mà nói, ngồi xem tivi và lướt web bao giờ cũng dễ dàng hơn… Thế nên đó chính là điều mà hầu hết chúng ta vẫn làm, và để cho khao khát của chúng ta vẫn mãi chỉ là những giấc mơ. Vẫn còn một sự thật không lấy gì làm dễ chịu, đó là: Có rất nhiều việc chẳng có gì thú vị cho tới khi chúng ta giỏi việc đó. Kỹ năng nào cũng có cái mà tôi vẫn gọi là rào cản thất vọng - thời điểm bạn cực kỳ không thạo (kỹ năng đó) và đau đớn nhận ra sự thật đó. Tại sao phải bắt đầu một việc mà bạn biết là bạn sẽ chẳng giỏi việc đó chứ? Chẳng phải sẽ rất tuyệt khi có thể thành thạo những kỹ năng mới mà không cần phải tức giận nhiều sao? Để nhanh chóng vượt qua rào cản thất vọng, để có thể chuyển tới phần thú vị, đáng giá? Để tốn ít thời gian cho việc bối rối và lúng túng, để có thêm thời gian thú vị? Liệu có thể học được những kỹ năng mới theo cách tốn ít thời gian và công sức hơn không? Từ kinh nghiệm của riêng tôi, xin trả lời là: Có, có thể.\nCuốn sách này là cuộc tìm kiếm của cá nhân tôi nhằm kiểm tra tính nghệ thuật và khoa học của việc học kỹ năng nhanh chóng - làm cách nào để học bất cứ kỹ năng nào nhanh nhất có thể. Mục đích của cuốn sách này là giúp bạn học được những kỹ năng mới trong khoảng thời gian kỷ lục. Theo kinh nghiệm của tôi, mất khoảng 20 giờ thực hành để phá vỡ rào cản thất vọng: để đi từ mức hoàn toàn không biết gì về việc bạn đang cố gắng làm tới mức có thể làm việc đó tốt một cách đáng ngạc nhiên. Cuốn sách này là cách tiếp cận mang tính hệ thống đối với vấn đề học kỹ năng mới nhanh nhất có thể. Phương pháp mang tính phổ quát. Vấn đề không phải là bạn muốn học ngoại ngữ, viết tiểu thuyết, vẽ chân dung, khởi nghiệp hay lái máy bay. Nếu bạn đầu tư ít nhất 20 tiếng để học những điều cơ bản của một kỹ năng, bạn sẽ ngạc nhiên với mức độ thành thạo mà bạn có thể đạt được. Bất kể kỹ năng bạn muốn học là gì, cuốn sách này cũng sẽ giúp bạn đạt được kỹ năng đó với ít thời gian và năng lượng lãng phí hơn. Chỉ cần một chút nỗ lực tập trung, có chiến lược, bạn sẽ thấy mình nhanh chóng tiến bộ mà không thất vọng.\nTrong cuốn sách này, chúng ta sẽ bắt đầu bằng những nguyên tắc học kỹ năng nhanh: làm cách nào để học những kỹ năng mới nhanh nhất có thể. Những ý tưởng và bài tập thực hành này không hề phức tạp, nên sẽ không mất quá nhiều thời gian để học. Sau đó, tôi sẽ giải thích cách sử dụng những nguyên tắc này trong thực tế bằng cách chỉ cho các bạn biết tôi đã học 6 kỹ năng mới dưới đây trong vòng chưa tới 20 tiếng mỗi kỹ năng, không quá 90 phút thực hành mỗi ngày, như thế nào.\nPhát triển bài tập yoga cá nhân\nViết chương trình máy tính dựa trên web\nHọc lại cách gõ 10 ngón\nKhám phá boardgame cổ nhất và phức tạp nhất trong lịch sử\nChơi được một nhạc cụ\nLướt ván\nTôi hi vọng cuốn sách này có thể khuyến khích bạn phủi bụi danh sách những việc “muốn làm” của bạn, kiểm tra lại danh sách đó và cam kết học được điều mới mẻ nào đó.\n",

Đó là những người trẻ dám thử sức với một việc làm cụ thể (phóng viên lữ hành, chăm sóc khách hàng, phát thanh viên, tổ chức hội chợ,…) - để học nghề, để kiếm tiền, để tự kiểm tra năng lực, để khẳng định sự tự lập, để tích lũy kinh nghiệm, để thỏa đam mê, hoặc vì mục địch khác. Quan trọng là họ đã nghĩ tới và thực sự dấn thân vào nghề, một cách nghiêm túc.\nTrong tập này, Chưa thử sao biết không thể, tác giả Lâm Moon là cô sinh viên có một cuộc sống hỗn độn, dễ nhàm chán, dễ khủng hoảng tinh thần, hay mất tập trung… Nhưng cô gái này cũng có nhiều dự định, nhiều tham vọng và muốn thực hiện để đánh dấu cho năm cô hai mươi, hai mốt, hai hai tuổi,… Vì vậy, cô rất vui khi lăn xả và trầy xước, để có thêm trải nghiệm và kể với bạn bè quanh mình. Đó là mở một shop bán hàng online mà không cần đồng vốn nào, rồi cũng từ xuất phát điểm là một… túi tiền rỗng, cô bạn tổ chức hội chợ. Chuyện thật khó tin, nhưng cô đã làm được, và quan trọng nữa là thu thập cho chính mình những bài học quý báu về kinh doanh và quản lý một thương hiệu.

Đối với Moon, lần thử này như một khóa học không tốn phí mà còn được trả lương.\nSách phù hợp với tuổi 18 đến 25, đặc biệt là các bạn sinh viên.\n",

    "description": "Bí quyết để đạt được ước mơ sẽ giúp bạn nhận biết những rào cản khiến mình không thể đưa ra lời yêu cầu và từ đó giúp bạn xác định được những đề xuất và phương cách hiệu quả để vượt qua chúng. Với nhiều câu chuyện thú vị và sâu sắc của những con người đã đạt được thành công bằng việc nêu lên yêu cầu, cuốn sách này sẽ mang đến cho bạn cách thay đổi cuộc sống - bất kể bạn đang gặp phải trở ngại nào. Và nhờ đó, bạn sẽ có được một cuộc sống như mong đợi - một kho báu không phải từ cây đèn thần mà xuất phát từ chính trái tim bạn.\nBạn đọc sẽ có dịp theo chân của cậu bé Aladdin nghèo khổ khám phá những giá trị cuộc sống và những “rào cản” lớn nhất ngăn cản chúng ta có được điều mình ao ước. Và khi đã dần trưởng thành, nắm được những ý nghĩa của ước mơ và tìm cách đạt được nó, cậu bé được gọi là người chủ của thần đèn. Đan xen vào câu chuyện của Aladdin, cuốn sách chia sẻ những chỉ dẫn chân thành, dễ hiểu, dễ thực hiện thông qua rất nhiều câu chuyện thực tế, sinh động khác. Với nội dung được trình bày theo một logic thú vị và độc đáo, đây thực sự là một cuốn sách có kết cấu mới lạ trong loạt sách Sống đẹp. Mỗi chương sách là một cánh cửa mở ra những điều mới mẻ để bạn đạt được ước mơ của mình: Động viên bản thân bằng những lời tích cực, Hãy yêu cầu để giấc mơ trở thành sự thật, Cho đi để nhận lại.. cùng vô số những gợi ý để chúng ta sống tốt mỗi ngày.\nKhi tiếp nhận kinh nghiệm được chuyển tải qua nội dung cuốn sách, bạn sẽ dần nhận ra sứ mệnh của bản thân cũng như định hướng rõ con đường mà mình sẽ theo đuổi, đồng thời khơi dậy niềm đam mê để hiện thực hóa ước mơ của mình.\nNhững người đạt được điều mình mong muốn - những người chủ của thần đèn luôn biết cách tìm kiếm sự hỗ trợ của mọi người, cả trong lĩnh vực tài chính lẫn đời sống tinh thần. Họ đề nghị mọi người tài trợ, đầu tư vào các kế hoạch, dự án hay công trình nghiên cứu của mình. Như câu chuyện một nhà văn nghèo ấp ủ viết nên một tác phẩm để đời, nhưng do không đủ khả năng tài chính đã yêu cầu bạn bè giúp đỡ. Số tiền nhận được đã giúp ông trang trải tất cả chi phí trong một năm - khoảng thời gian ông hoàn thành tác phẩm. Cuốn sách nhanh chóng trở thành tác phẩm bán chạy nhất và nhà văn ấy đã thu về gần 400 ngàn đô-la, đủ để ông trả hết những khoản nợ đã vay cộng thêm tiền lãi.\nNhững người chủ thần đèn cũng luôn khao khát tìm kiếm thông tin, lời khuyên cũng như nhận xét, góp ý từ mọi người. Họ luôn cố gắng hoàn thiện bản thân mỗi ngày bằng cách vươn tới những mục tiêu như thăng tiến, tăng thu nhập, được mọi người yêu mến, ngưỡng mộ.\nMột vận động viên nhảy sào đã quyết định tạm ngưng mọi kế hoạch tập luyện và tìm đến một cựu vô địch Olympic bộ môn này để học hỏi kinh nghiệm. Và sau một thời gian được huấn luyện kỹ càng, anh đã đoạt huy chương vàng môn nhảy sào, đồng thời phá luôn kỷ lục của nhà vô địch kia.\nỞ một khía cạnh nào đó, những người chủ thần đèn cũng phải đối mặt với các khó khăn như tất cả chúng ta khi thể hiện bản thân. Họ cũng từng lo lắng, sợ hãi, mặc cảm và tự ti. Nhưng trên hết, họ luôn biết cách đối mặt với trở ngại cũng như dũng cảm đấu tranh để loại bỏ chướng ngại vật trên đường đi đến thành công. Nếu người khác có thể làm được thì chắc chắn bạn cũng sẽ làm được. Đây là điều được đúc kết từ kinh nghiệm của những người đã từng vượt qua nỗi sợ của bản thân để đạt được thành công.\n“Hãy lên tiếng yêu cầu, cho đến khi mọi giấc mơ của bạn đều trở thành sự thật” đó là thông điệp được truyền tải qua cuốn sách.\n",

    "description": "Thay đổi để có thái độ tích cực\nDám Thay Đổi được First News mua bản quyền và biên dịch từ The A to Z Challenge của tập đoàn BK Publications, Anh Quốc. Đây là cuốn sách có ý nghĩa sâu sắc về tinh thần, đặc biệt là cho những người đang ở trong tâm trạng và hoàn cảnh không thuận lợi, nhàm chán; mong muốn được thay đổi thái độ và nội tâm để có một tinh thần lạc quan, tích cực hơn.\nTrong cuộc sống, chúng ta thường không tránh khỏi những lúc giận dữ, lo lắng hay thất vọng. Đó là điều bình thường nhưng nếu càng ở lâu với những cảm giác đó bạn sẽ càng cảm thấy bi quan, theo đó sẽ nảy sinh những suy nghĩ tiêu cực thường trực. Đôi khi chỉ cần một lời an ủi, động viên đúng lúc hay một sự thay đổi từ bản thân cũng làm nên điều kỳ diệu cho chính bạn - đó là sự chuyển hóa từ thái độ tiêu cực thành tích cực. Điều này rất có ý nghĩa với cuộc sống hiện tại của bạn. Bởi vì một cách nghĩ, cách nhìn và một thái độ tích cực có thể sẽ xua tan đi tất cả sự mệt mỏi, căng thẳng, mang lại cho bạn một năng lượng mới. Cuốn sách Dám Thay Đổi là một lời giải giúp bạn đạt được điều này.\nTrong cuốn sách này, ngoài việc chỉ ra những tâm trạng tiêu cực mà mọi người vẫn luôn phải đối diện trong cuộc sống, hai tác giả Inner Space và Covent Garden còn cung cấp cho bạn đọc tác hại mà những tâm trạng tiêu cực đó mang lại. Thêm vào đó, Inner Space và Covent Garden cũng giúp bạn đọc những cách thức để chuyến hóa những thái độ tiêu cực thành tích cực. Chẳng hạn với thái độ phàn nàn, hai tác giả chỉ ra: “Phàn nàn phá hỏng tâm trạng và triệt tiêu động lực của ta, cũng như của những người khác”. Để quên đi thái độ phàn nàn, hai tác giả đưa ra lời khuyên: “Luôn có điều gì đó để ta trân trọng và biết ơn, chẳng hạn như một mái nhà che mưa che nắng hay một buổi bình minh tuyệt đẹp”.\nThái độ hối tiếc thường có nguồn gốc từ những việc bạn đã làm hay chưa làm trong quá khứ. Hai tác giả Inner Space và Covent Garden cho rằng: “Những tổn thương quá khứ cứ mãi dai dẳng bởi vì ta liên tục hồi tưởng về chúng”. Vì vậy, nếu chúng ta cứ chìm đắm trong tâm trạng hối tiếc thì chúng ta sẽ chẳng bao giờ làm tốt công việc của hiện tại. Inner Space và Covent Garden đã cho chúng ta hiểu bản chất của hối tiếc bằng một thái độ lạc quan khi cho rằng, mọi việc xảy ra đều có lý do của nó. Bên cạnh đó, với những câu chuyện, sự việc đã qua dù là thành công hay thất bại thì đó vẫn luôn là điều có ích trong mọi chuyện, để chúng ta có thể học hỏi được điều gì từ đó. Để tránh phải hối tiếc trong tương lai, hai tác giả chỉ ra: “Hãy suy nghĩ trước khi hành động. Đừng bỡn cợt. Làm những gì bạn yêu thích và sống khoảnh khắc hiện tại”.\nMỗi một chủ đề, một tâm trạng được gọi tên theo thứ tự chữ cái từ A - Z như A - Anger (Giận dữ), B - Bored (Nhàm chán), H - Hurt (Tổn thương), I - Indecision (Do dự), Z - Zero (Số không)…, Ngoài ra, mỗi trang sách được trình bày 4 màu do họa sĩ Paloma Spath minh họa với những hình ảnh, kiểu chữ lạ mắt, tươi vui và sinh động không chỉ đưa ra những gợi mở để bạn đọc tham khảo và tìm cách thay đổi mà còn giúp họ cảm thấy hưng phấn hơn khi lật giở từng trang sách.\nĐặc biệt, với Dám Thay Đổi lần này cũng là một dấu mốc về sự thay đổi mạnh mẽ của First News trong việc tiếp cận bạn đọc thông qua hình thức trình bày mới lạ. Không giống như những quyển sách thông thường, lần này Dám Thay Đổi được thiết kế theo mô hình lịch để bàn, được đóng lò xo ở phần gáy. Vì lẽ đó, đây cũng có thể được xem như là một món quà đầy ý nghĩa dành tặng cho những tâm hồn đang có mong muốn được “chuyển hóa” - hướng tới một thái độ tích cực.\nNhững trích dẫn đặc sắc:\n“Sự nhàm chán chỉ tạm thời nguôi ngoai trong khi ta mải mê với những trò tiêu khiển, nhưng ngay khi dừng cuộc chơi, ta lại rơi vào cảm giác chán chường”.\n“Nỗi sợ cũng giống như một thỏi nam châm. Nếu cứ tập trung vào nỗi sợ mơ hồ nào đó, dù không chủ ý thì bạn cũng sẽ hành động với nỗi sợ hãi, từ đó làm cho nó trở nên sống động y như thật”.\n“Những tổn thương quá khứ cứ mãi dai dẳng bởi vì ta liên tục hồi tưởng về chúng. Chính BẠN mới là người làm cho mình bị tổn thương”.\n“Ghen tị thường xuất phát từ việc hạ thấp bản thân và so sánh”.\n",

    "description": "Có bao nhiêu người trong số chúng ta biết rằng ở trên cái nơi mà chúng ta yên vị có một thế giới với ánh sáng ngập tràn, một cuộc sống không giới hạn và nơi mà hiện thực tươi sáng hơn đang chờ đón chúng ta. Cuộc sống đẳng cấp là hoa tiêu của bạn, là bản phác thảo chi tiết về “tầng hầm” nơi bạn đang yên vị và tấm bản đồ hữu hiệu đưa bạn tới một thực tại đẳng cấp hơn cả trí tưởng tượng của bạn. Nó là cuộc hành trình nhằm thay đổi bản thân và chuyến hành trình này có thể giúp bạn thay đổi cách nhìn nhận về chính bản thân mình trong cuộc sống, về mục tiêu và cách thức để đạt được mục tiêu đó. Nó là những bậc cầu thang đang ở đó đợi chờ bạn, nhưng bạn không thể nhìn thấy nó nếu sống trong sự hỗn loạn và bị lớp màn của những bảo thủ, trì trệ che phủ. Mỗi người chúng ta đều đáng được hưởng những cơ hội để tiến lên và trở thành một phiên bản tốt đẹp hơn của chính bản thân mình, luyện tập và rèn giũa chính bản thân mình để đạt tới đẳng cấp mới.\nVà thật thú vị là, kể cả chúng ta có trưởng thành hay tiến hóa thế nào thì vẫn có những đẳng cấp mới đang chờ đón. Kể cả khi có bao nhiêu ánh sáng đang tràn ngập quanh bạn, vẫn có một cây cầu thang chờ đón bạn để đón bạn đến với đẳng cấp sống cao hơn.Những tri thức mà bạn học được từ những trang sách này không phải chỉ để đọc lướt qua mà là để tiếp thu và suy ngẫm. Tôi “thách thức” xem bạn có dám nghĩ mình là ai và mình muốn gì không. Tôi sẽ khuyến khích bạn tạo lập những mục tiêu để mở rộng ý tưởng của mình nhiều nhất có thể và cho phép bạn thực sự hành động để hiện thực hóa kế hoạch của mình.Tác giả muốn khuyến khích bạn đọc thành thật với bản thân mình và càng cụ thể càng tốt trong việc đối phó với những “cái gì” trong cuộc sống của mình. Bạn sẽ tìm hiểu về quá khứ và loại bỏ những ý tưởng, những niềm tin mù quáng và cả những vấn đề khúc mắc trên hành trình. Đây không phải là một cuộc hành trình dễ dàng, nhưng chắc chắn sẽ là một hành trình đem lại cho bạn sự hài lòng và sung túc. Nó có thể sẽ đầy chông gai, nhưng, bạn biết đấy - thay đổi không phải lúc nào cũng mang về những trải nghiệm dễ chịu.\nĐây là một trong những lý do mà đa phần mọi người không tận dụng được vô vàn những cơ hội trong cuộc sống. Họ lẩn mình sau bức tường cố hữu của những thứ gọi là “phải”, “nên”, “không thể”. Sự mù quáng chấp nhận những điều được cho là bất khả thi làm họ để lỡ một tràng giang đại hải những lựa chọn quanh mình. Sự mù quáng tồn tại trong con người ta giống như người đàn ông dưới tầng hầm, phổ biến với cả nam giới và nữ giới. Tuy nhiên, phụ nữ có tỷ lệ “an phận” và chấp nhận thực tế, không cố gắng tìm cách giải quyết vấn đề cao hơn nam giới.\nKhi chúng ta đã hiểu được về tất cả những cơ hội đang chờ đón mình thì chúng ta sẽ biết cách làm thế nào để nắm bắt chúng. Chỉ có một cách duy nhất để tìm ra bí mật ẩn sau những cơ hội và để khai phá chúng, đó là NIỀM TIN! Nếu niềm tin đến một cách dễ dàng thì ai cũng đã có thể thành công trong cuộc sống. Có thể nó là lý do mà bao người chấp nhận an phận với “thực tại” của mình, không tìm kiếm được một viễn cảnh tươi sáng hơn. Dường như chúng ta luôn đạt đến cái ngưỡng của sự lú lẫn, trước khi tìm cách thoát ra khỏi thực tại và hành động. Đến bước đó, chúng ta sẽ có thể sẵn sàng làm những gì cần thiết thay vì những gì vẫn làm theo thói quen. Nó là bậc đầu tiên trong cây cầu thang mà tác giả nói đến.\nThông điệp tổng quát mỗi ngày và cũng là những bài học hữu ích bao gồm một chuỗi những hoạt động định hướng bạn tới cung đường đi đúng đắn để giúp bạn tới đẳng cấp mới. Mục tiêu của chúng tôi là giúp bạn cân bằng tri thức cũng như khai mở những tìm tòi cá nhân, cùng với sự tham gia nhiệt tình và năng động của bạn. Dù sao chăng nữa, nếu chỉ nắm lý thuyết về chuyến hành trình và mơ mộng về nó thì cũng chẳng giúp bạn tiến lên được bao nhiêu.\nVì vậy, mỗi ngày bạn sẽ tiến thêm một bước bằng việc…\nViết một danh sách những người mà bạn biết ơn\nĐọc và nghiền ngẫm những bài học\nCuộc sống đẳng cấp của mình\nHoàn thành các bài tập hành động sau mỗi bài học\nKết thúc mỗi ngày bằng việc tự nhìn lại mình\nBạn chỉ cần dành ra 7 phút vào buổi sáng và chỉ cần 15 phút trong thời gian còn lại mỗi ngày cho việc đọc, cho những hoạt động và tổng hợp lại.\nNếu bạn biết dành ra 22 phút mỗi ngày, trong 32 ngày liền, bạn có tin bạn sẽ làm thay đổi chính cuộc đời mình hay không?Không bao giờ được đánh giá thấp những gì mà bạn có thể làm được trong vòng 32 ngày, bạn nhé!\n",

    "description": "Có những lúc ta phải tự mình quyết định rằng mình là ai và mình muốn trở thành người như thế nào. Khoảnh khắc đó xuất hiện khi ta muốn “hồi sinh” cuộc sống của bản thân sau những nếm trải đớn đau và bi phẫn. Đó là khi ta đã chịu đựng rất nhiều vết thương lòng và muốn đứng dậy từ những bài học xương máu ấy để hoàn thiện bản thân và sẵn sàng đối mặt với cuộc sống.\nTrong những thời khắc như vậy, ta cần phải xác định rõ ràng những quan điểm và hành vi nào mình sẽ giữ làm hành trang đi suốt cuộc đời và những điều gì bản thân nên loại bỏ. Liệu cuộc sống mà chúng ta đang vẽ ra cho chính mình trong giai đoạn phục hồi này có tiến triển suôn sẻ khi ta luôn bị cầm tù trong những bi hận của quá khứ? Nó sẽ khiến ta phải trả giá thế nào, xét về cả sự hạnh phúc và khía cạnh làm người, nếu ta cứ mãi nhìn về những khổ đau từng nếm trải để mà đổ lỗi và oán trách?\nChúng ta không thể trong chốc lát mà bước qua nỗi đau và cả lòng oán hận để thanh thản tha thứ nếu chưa trải nghiệm những cảm giác này và giúp bản thân lấy lại những giá trị đã mất. “Quên hôm qua” và “Sống cho ngày mai” là hai bước lớn trong hành trình sống tốt và sống hạnh phúc. Thiếu hai yếu tố này, chúng ta sẽ không bao giờ giải thoát được mình khỏi sự bủa vây của bóng ma quá khứ.\nTất chúng ta đều xứng đáng được hưởng một tương lai tốt đẹp. Và bạn không cần phải căm ghét hay hằn học quá khứ nếu đã sẵn sàng vượt qua những ám ảnh đó để sống hạnh phúc. Chỉ có ta mới giải phóng được cho chính mình. Không ai khác có thể làm thay ta điều đó.\nQuên hôm qua - Sống cho ngày mai là cuốn sách được viết từ những chiêm nghiệm trong cuộc sống hàng ngày, giúp mỗi người tìm về và sống trọn vẹn với những giá trị của bản thân. Đây cũng là cuốn sách được viết từ niềm tin, hy vọng và nghị lực của một con người đã tự vươn lên tìm kiếm sự đổi thay cho cuộc đời mình.\n",

    "description": "Đi ra từ bóng tối - Phần kết của câu chuyện nổi tiếng Không Nơi Nương Tựa và Đứa Trẻ Lạc Loài.\nĐi ra từ bóng tối là phần kết thúc được chờ đợi từ rất lâu trong bộ ba tác phẩm: Không nơi nương tựa và Ra đi từ bóng tối. Câu chuyện là hồi kết cho cuộc đấu tranh sinh tồn không ngừng của cậu bé David đáng thương qua bao năm tháng sống trong sự bạo hành về thể xác lẫn tinh thần do chính người mẹ ruột gây ra. Câu chuyện đưa người đọc đi cùng chàng trai tên Dave qua những khúc quanh cuộc đời để trở thành một người đàn ông trưởng thành, đầy khát vọng sống. Giấc mơ cuộc đời, thất bại đắng cay, vinh quang ngọt ngào và hạnh phúc vẹn tròn là những gì người đọc sẽ cảm nhận được bằng những rung cảm chân thật nhất, sâu sắc nhất đằng sau những trang sách sống động của Đi ra từ bóng tối.\nChàng thanh niên tên Dave sẽ phải đối diện như thế nào trước sự thật rằng cha mình - vị anh hùng trong những giấc mơ thuở bé của cậu - sẽ không còn sống được bao lâu nữa? Cậu sẽ làm gì với tâm nguyện một lần được trò chuyện với cha như bao đứa con trai bình thường khác khi ông thậm chí còn không đủ sức để siết nhẹ bàn tay cậu? Cậu sẽ đối xử như thế nào với người mẹ nghiện ngập, tàn bạo - người đã chối bỏ sự tồn tại của con trai mình và đem đến bao nỗi kinh hoàng cho tuổi thơ của nó? Và cuối cùng, liệu có ai đó để cậu yêu thương, tin tưởng và giúp cậu lấy lại niềm tin vào tình cảm thiêng liêng của gia đình hay không? Đi ra từ bóng tối sẽ lần lượt giúp người đọc tháo gỡ tất cả những nút thắt ấy, dẫn dắt chúng ta tìm ra câu trả lời cho số phận của Dave, của từng nhân vật trong tác phẩm tự truyện. Và, có thể ở đâu đó trong tác phẩm, người đọc cũng sẽ tìm thấy câu trả lời cho cuộc đời của chính mình - như những ai đã có may mắn được là người đầu tiên đọc và làm công việc chuyển ngữ cho bộ ba tác phẩm này vậy.\nVới sự bao dung vô biên và lòng can đảm tuyệt vời Dave Plezer đã làm nên một kết thúc hoàn hảo cho bộ ba tự truyện của mình cũng như cho chính cuộc đời của ông. Bằng kết thúc ấy, Dave Pelzer đã minh chứng một cách hùng hồn rằng: Không một thế lực, một xiềng xích nào có thể trói buộc được ý chí của con người. Ý nghĩa lớn lao này thật quý giá biết bao đối với những ai đang trên con đường đi tìm hạnh phúc đích thực trong cuộc sống.\n",

    "description": "Chúng ta thường tự cho rằng con người là sinh vật có lý trí mạnh mẽ, khi quyết định hay đánh giá vấn đề luôn kĩ lưỡng và lý tính. Nhưng sự thật là, dù bạn có cẩn trọng tới mức nào, thì trong cuộc sống hàng ngày hay trong vấn đề liên quan đến kinh tế, bạn vẫn có những quyết định dựa trên cảm tính chủ quan của mình. Thinking fast and slow, cuốn sách nổi tiếng tổng hợp tất cả nghiên cứu được tiến hành qua nhiều thập kỷ của nhà tâm lý học từng đạt giải Nobel Kinh tế Daniel Kahneman sẽ cho bạn thấy những sư hợp lý và phi lý trong tư duy của chính bạn. Cuốn sách được đánh giá là “kiệt tác” trong việc thay đổi hành vi của con người, Thinking fast and slow đã dành được vô số giải thưởng danh giá, lọt vào Top 11 cuốn sách kinh doanh hấp dẫn nhất năm 2011. Alpha Books đã mua bản quyền và sẽ xuất bản cuốn sách trong Quý 1 năm nay. Thinking fast and slow dù là cuốn sách có tính hàn lâm cao nhưng vô cùng bổ ích với tất cả mọi người và đặc biệt rất dễ hiểu và vui nhộn.\nĐã có rất nhiều cuốn sách nói về tính hợp lý và phi lý của con người trong tư duy, trong việc đánh giá và ra quyết định, nhưng Thinking fast and slow được Tạp chí Tài chính Mỹ đánh giá là “kiệt tác”.\nBạn nghĩ rằng bạn tư duy nhanh, hay chậm? Bạn tư duy và suy nghĩ theo lối “trông mặt bắt hình dong”, đánh giá mọi vật nhanh chóng bằng cảm quan, quyết định dựa theo cảm xúc hay tư duy một cách cẩn thận, chậm rãi nhưng logic hợp lý về một vấn đề. Thinking fast and slow sẽ đưa ra và lý giải hai hệ thống tư duy tác động đến con đường nhận thức của bạn. Kahneman gọi đó là: hệ thống 1 và hệ thống 2. Hệ thống 1, còn gọi là cơ chế nghĩ nhanh, tự động, thường xuyên được sử dụng, cảm tính, rập khuôn và tiềm thức. Hệ thống 2, còn gọi là cơ chế nghĩ chậm, đòi hỏi ít nỗ lực, ít được sử dụng, dùng logic có tính toán và ý thức. Trong một loạt thí nghiệm tâm lý mang tính tiên phong, Kahneman và Tversky chứng minh rằng, con người chúng ta thường đi đến quyết định theo cơ chế nghĩ nhanh hơn là ghĩ chậm. Phần lớn nội dung của cuốn sách chỉ ra những sai lầm của con người khi suy nghĩ theo hệ thống 1. Kahneman chứng minh rằng chúng ta tệ hơn những gì chúng ta tưởng: đó là chúng ta không biết những gì chúng ta không biết! Cuốn sách đặc biệt đã dành được vô số giải thưởng danh giá: Sách khoa học hay nhất của Học viện Khoa học Quốc gia năm 2012, được tạp chí The New York Times bình chọn là sách hay nhất năm 2011, một trong những cuốn sách kinh tế xuất sắc năm 2011, chiến thắng giải thưởng cuốn sách được quan tâm nhất năm 2011 của tạp chí Los Algeles… Thinking fast and slow đáp ứng hai tiêu chí của một cuốn sách hay, thứ nhất nó thách thức quan điểm của người đọc, thứ hai, nó không phải là những trang sách với những con chữ khô cứng mà nó vô cùng vui nhộn và hấp dẫn. Không nghi ngờ gì nữa, đây là cuốn sách hàn lâm dành cho tất cả mọi người.! Thông tin tác giả\nDaniel Kahneman, sinh năm 1934, nhà tâm lý học người Mỹ  gốc Israel đã dành giải Nobel Kinh tế năm 2002. Ông dành cả cuộc đời của mình để nghiên cứu về tâm lý học hành vi con người. Cùng với người cộng sự đã qua đời Amos Tversky, hai ông đã có được những nghiên cứu sâu sắc về con đường tư duy và nhận thức của con người.\n",

Ngược lại, tình cha gợi nên một hình tượng vững vàng, đáng tin cậy hơn của một người bảo vệ, tin yêu; người mang lại sự hiểu biết và sức mạnh cho con trẻ.\nNhững câu chuyện trong cuốn sách này viết về tình yêu thương của người cha dành cho con, về hình ảnh người cha với nhiều cung bậc tình cảm khác nhau; nhưng có một điểm chung là: tất cả đều gây xúc động và truyền cảm hứng thật sự đến người đọc. Nhiều câu chuyện được những người cha viết lại, nhưng bạn cũng có thể cảm nhận được xúc cảm chân thành của những người con trai, con gái - những người đã cảm nhận, thấu hiểu và trở nên tốt đẹp hơn nhờ tình yêu của cha, dù rằng đó là cha dượng hay cha nuôi.\nCó thể một số câu chuyện sẽ giúp bạn hài lòng với vai trò tuyệt đối quan trọng của một người cha, một số khác sẽ mang lại cho bạn những ý tưởng mới để thể hiện tình yêu thương dành cho gia đình. Số khác lại có thể khiến tâm hồn bạn rung động và đánh thức sự thật đang được che giấu về tình yêu sâu sắc mà cha bạn không thể hiện ra.\nNhận định\n“Mỗi câu chuyện là một thông điệp có thể hàn gắn vết thương, làm thay đổi suy nghĩ, tâm hồn và đôi khi, cả cuộc đời bạn. Chúng tôi thật sự tin rằng những câu chuyện này sẽ làm nên sự khác biệt, mang lại nguồn cảm hứng vô tận cho bạn, vì chính cuộc sống tinh thần của chúng tôi cũng sẽ tốt hơn sau mỗi lần đọc một câu chuyện hay. Một khi đã được truyền cảm hứng, bạn đều có thể đem đến những điều tốt đẹp cho bạn thân mình và những người xung quanh”\n(Jack Canfield - Mark Victor Hansen)\n",

    "description": "Trong cuộc sống chúng ta ai cũng có một uớc mơ cho một ngày mai thật đẹp, dù bình dị hay phi thường. Những ước mơ đáng quý, đáng trân trọng đó luôn là niềm hy vọng, là nguồn động lực và niềm tin lớn nhất cho mỗi người để sống, để cảm nhận và hướng đến ngày mai. Có ba điều chính yếu tạo nên một cuộc sống viên mãn, đó là niềm đam mê cháy bỏng, nỗ lực hết mình và mục đích cuối cùng. Thực tế đã chứng minh rằng không ai có thể duy trì được động lực của mình trong một thời gian dài mà không hiểu rõ ba khái niệm trên. Zig Ziglar, tác giả của cuốn sách Better Than Good - Vươn Đến Sự Hoàn Thiện cũng cho rằng không ai thụ hưởng một cuộc sống viên mãn mà không cần đến một động lực nào.\nDẫu trải qua bao đổi thay trên đường đời, Zig Ziglar vẫn luôn kiên định với điều mà ông gọi là sứ mệnh của mình: giúp đỡ người khác thực hiện ước mơ và theo đuổi mục đích sống tốt đẹp. Và Better Than Good được viết ra từ kinh nghiệm của hơn 50 năm bán hàng, làm diễn giả, tác giả và doanh nhân đẳng cấp thế giới của ông, sẽ giúp bạn biết cách chế ngự nỗi sợ hãi, quẳng đi nỗi lo âu và tâm lý thất bại để vươn đến một cuộc sống viên mãn, cả về vật chất và tinh thần, sức khỏe và tâm hồn…\nCuốn sách giúp chúng ta biết cách kết nối ba yếu tố đam mê cháy bỏng, nỗ lực hết mình và mục đích tối thượng lại với nhau. Dù là trong các hoạt động thể thao, kinh doanh, nghiên cứu khoa học, y học, giáo dục, phục vụ cộng đồng, thì không có người nào làm việc hết sức mình mà lại không mảy may có một chút đam mê. Trên bước đường vươn đến cuộc sống viên mãn, rất có thể bạn sẽ gặp thất bại, sẽ nản lòng thoái chí, bị lợi dụng, bị bạn bè chơi khăm, bị vắt kiệt cả tiền tài lẫn sức lực… Dường như lúc nào cũng có những nguyên nhân rất thuyết phục khiến chúng ta phải chùn bước và muốn buông bỏ. Những lúc như vậy, nếu không có niềm đam mê thực sự, có thể bạn sẽ bỏ cuộc nửa chừng. Đó chính là lý do tại sao niềm đam mê lại là điều tiên quyết cần có trong ba yếu tố kể trên. Tiếp đến là sự nỗ lực hết mình. Điều này phụ thuộc rất nhiều vào niềm đam mê, tính kiên nhẫn, lòng quyết tâm và thái độ sẵn sàng làm việc cho đến khi bạn có thể vận hành mọi cỗ máy một cách trơn tru, như ý. Nỗ lực hết mình thực sự chịu ảnh hưởng từ những yếu tố như thể chất, tinh thần, công việc và gia đình của bạn.\nYếu tố thứ ba - mục đích - chính là chìa khóa mở ra một cuộc sống viên mãn. Đây là một vấn đề không hề đơn giản chút nào. Do những rào cản từ phía gia đình, xã hội hay do khả năng tài chính hạn hẹp, có thể sẽ rất khó khăn nếu bạn muốn chuyển hướng và bắt tay vào thực hiện những điều mình hằng ấp ủ, mong muốn. Vâng, đúng là khó khăn thật đấy… nhưng đó không phải là việc bất khả thi. Và một điều chắc chắn rằng, nếu bạn thực sự đam mê một điều gì đó - và nếu bạn xem đó là sứ mệnh mà bạn phải hoàn thành - thì bạn sẽ làm được.\nVới phần nội dung bàn luận sâu về mục đích - từ định nghĩa cho đến cách thức xác định mục đích. Và, mục đích có thể thay đổi cuộc đời chúng ta như thế nào? Phần III của quyển sách này - Mục đích của cuộc sống viên mãn - bạn sẽ khám phá ra những điều thú vị và độc đáo mà rất ít người quan tâm. Từ những chân giá trị và tầm quan trọng của việc xác định mục đích tối thượng của cuộc sống mà tác giả đã nhìn nhận được, ông chia sẻ với bạn đọc những ý niệm về nhân sinh, về cuộc đời. Từ đó, mỗi người có thể sống trọn vẹn với niềm đam mê, để nỗ lực hết mình và đạt được những gì mà bạn cho là mục đích của cuộc đời.\n",

Như người đi trong bão mà không có nhiều vật dụng che chắn, họ giữ chặt lấy niềm tin vào giá trị của sự học rằng mỗi con chữ, mỗi kiến thức là một nhịp cầu bắc đến nghề nghiệp mơ ước tương lai. Niềm tin ấy giàu sức sống, lan tỏa mạnh bởi gắn liền với những nỗ lực mỗi ngày. Và chẳng có lý do gì để không hy vọng rằng trong một ngày mai rất gần, đất nước có thêm những giáo viên, bác sĩ, chuyên gia tâm lý... giỏi nghề - nâng niu thế hệ tiếp nối như cách trả ơn cuộc đời - bởi họ vốn là những bông hoa nở trên sỏi đá.\nKhi cuộc sống càng nhiều thách thức thì có lẽ, món quà ý nghĩa nhất trao tặng nhau là tinh thần sống không ngại gian khó. Hy vọng rằng khi khép lại quyển sách nhỏ này, nhiều bạn đọc sẽ cảm thấy được truyền thêm cảm hứng sống hết mình cho những ước mơ. Và khi ấy, chính bạn cũng là một điều kỳ diệu của cuộc đời - như những cánh hoa bồ công anh luôn sẵn sàng mang cái đẹp đến những miền xa.\n",

    "description": "Làm thế nào để diễn tốt vai diễn trong công việc ? Làm việc cùng người hướng nội như thế nào? Xử lý tình trạng tranh chấp không nhượng bộ như thế nào ? Nhìn nhận vấn đề công bằng nơi làm việc như thế nào ? Bồi dưỡng tinh thần hợp tác thế nào? Điều chỉnh ý nghĩ thường xuyên thích thay đổi nhiều công việc như thế nào? Làm sao để chuyên tâm với công việc hiện tại? Làm sao để giao tiếp thuận lợi với người khác? Làm sao để công ty hoan hỉ tự tại? Cuốn sách này đề cập đến những vấn đề nghi hoặc khó hiểu thường gặp trong công việc, cùng với đó là sự phá cách về cách đặt câu hỏi, cách vào đề thực dụng nhất, trực tiếp nhất. Mặc dù công việc thiên biến vạn hóa, thay đổi nhanh chóng như thế nào, khi có thiền pháp làm phương pháp an định nhân tâm thì dù gặp kẻ có lòng tham, kẻ hay nghi hoặc, ta đều có thể giữ được tâm thiền, trong lòng luôn cảm thấy thanh tịnh, công việc không còn bó hẹp trong khoảng thời gian từ 9 giờ sáng đến 5 giờ chiều nữa, mà ta sẽ mở ra chân trời mới. Hãy để chúng ta đi làm bằng thiền tâm, để tinh thần càng sảng khoái hơn! Hy vọng rằng sau khi tất cả các vấn đề được hóa giải bằng thiền tâm thì mọi phiền não trong công việc đều trở thành một phần kiến thức của cuộc sống. Trích đoạn hay: ...Trong công việc, dù ta hợp tác cùng ai thì cũng nên tôn trọng họ, coi họ như những vị Bồ Tát bên mình. Ví như trong tập thể Pháp Cổ Sơn, mọi người đều gọi nhau bằng \"Bồ Tát\", chính là đối đãi với họ như đối đãi với các vị Bồ Tát. Cho dù làm việc cùng người không thân thiện, không chịu hợp tác hoặc người có năng lực kém, ta vẫn nên giữ thái độ như trên, tuyệt đối không được hoài nghi về năng lực hoặc thái độ làm việc của họ. Đã là cộng sự với nhau thì nên coi đối phương là một vị Bồ Tát, tôn trọng nhân cách của họ. Do vậy, giữa đồng sự với nhau không nên dùng lời lẽ thô tục, lời lẽ chua ngoa cay nghiệt hoặc những lời trách móc nặng nề, mà ta phải dùng ngôn từ tôn kính, bày tỏ thiện ý, ví dụ như các từ xin ý kiến chỉ bảo của anh, anh làm ơn cho tôi hỏi, đúng như vậy, đúng là thế, anh làm rất tốt v.v… Mặt khác, khi ở trong trường hợp có nhiều quan điểm bất đồng, chúng ta cũng không được dùng mệnh lệnh hoặc có thái độ phản kháng kịch liệt, mà nên dùng phương pháp thương lượng hòa giải tìm ra tiếng nói chung để giải quyết vấn đề. Cấp trên cũng nên tôn trọng nhân viên trong công ty, và ý kiến của nhiều người khác, còn người thi hành nhiệm vụ thì phải làm theo sự chỉ đạo của cấp trên. Nếu cấp dưới không đồng tình với sự phân công công việc của cấp trên thì nên đưa ra lí do và ý kiến về việc không chấp hành đó, chứ không cần thiết chống đối kháng cự, đối lập với cấp trên, tốt nhất là dùng phương thức thương lượng để giải quyết vấn đề. Ví như khi cấp trên truyền đạt mệnh lệnh xuống cấp dưới, nếu cấp dưới có quan điểm riêng thì cần đưa ra ý kiến rõ ràng, có thể nói như sau: \" đúng như vậy, việc này cấp trên suy xét rất chu đáo, nhưng dưới góc độ là người thi hành nhiệm vụ tôi thấy còn cách khác tiết kiệm về thời gian và tiền bạc hơn….\" Khi bàn giao công việc tuyệt đối không dùng mệnh lệnh yêu cầu người khác chấp hành, mà nên hỏi xem trong khoảng thời gian hạn hẹp như vậy họ có hoàn thành công việc không và xem xét đến một số trường hợp phát sinh khác trong khi hợp tác với nhau. Nếu có đủ tín nhiệm thì người thi hành nhiệm vụ sẽ hoàn thành tốt nhiệm vụ được bàn giao. Do đó có thể thấy, sự giao tiếp tốt giữa chủ quản và người thi hành nhiệm vụ là điều kiện tất yếu khiến công việc được thuận lợi...\n***\nHòa thượng Thích Thánh Nghiêm (1930-2009) xuất gia từ năm 13 tuổi. Ngài đã từng nhập thất sáu năm tại núi Cao Hùng, Đài Loan, đi du học tại Nhật Bản, nhận bằng Tiến sĩ văn học, Viện trưởng Viện Nghiên cứu và Phiên dịch kinh Phật... Bằng những nỗ lực không mệt mỏi nhằm đem lại lợi ích cho mọi người, Ngài được coi là một trong bốn vị hòa thượng nổi tiếng và có tầm ảnh hưởng nhất tại Đài Loan thời hiện đại. Pháp sư Thánh Nghiêm là một nhà tư tưởng, một tác gia, một vị Thiền sư nổi tiếng thế giới, được tạp chí \"Thiên Hạ\" của Đài Loan đánh giá là một trong 50 nhân sỹ nổi tiếng có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn nhất trong lịch sử 400 năm qua. Tác phẩm của ngài phong phú, đa dạng về chủng loại bằng các thứ tiếng như tiếng Trung Quốc, tiếng Anh, tiếng Nhật; và nhận được nhiều giải thưởng như giải thưởng văn nghệ Trung Sơn, giải Học thuật Trung Sơn, và nhiều giải thưởng do các giới trong xã hội phong tặng. Sách đã in: -Bộ Phật Pháp Ứng dụng : Tu trong công việc, Tìm lại chính mình, Buông xả phiền não, An lạc từ tâm, Giao tiếp bằng trái tim, Vô ngã vô ưu.. - Tình thế gian, bình an trong nhân gian…\nMời các bạn đón đọc!\n",

Vì vậy xin giới thiệu với các bạn đọc quyển sách \"BÍ QUYẾT TIẾP CẬN HIỆU QUẢ KÌ THI THPT QUỐC GIA TÍCH PHÂN – SỐ PHỨC\".\nVới mục tiêu cung cấp cho các thầy cô giáo một tài liệu chuyên sâu có chất lượng và các em học sinh một tài liệu bổ ích và thiết thực.

Sau 3 tháng bạn có đến 12 giờ thực hành cũng như tích góp cho mình lượng kiến thức vô cùng vững vàng, giúp bạn tự tin hơn trong việc đối thoại với người nước ngoài. Được chia thành nhiều chương, có trường hợp cụ thể, xuyên suốt quá trình tự học, tác giả The Windy sẽ dẫn dắt bạn đến từng kiến thức được thiết kế khoa học, dễ hiểu. Tập trung vào yếu tố hình ảnh trực quan, chọn lọc nhiều mẫu câu giao tiếp đa dạng nhưng có tính ứng dụng cao, đồng thời giúp người dùng có thêm các phương pháp học hợp lý, 8 phút tự học giao tiếp tiếng Anh mỗi ngày là cuốn sách giúp bạn hình thành lên ý thức và thói quen tự học hằng ngày, nhằm nâng cao vốn kiến thức, rèn luyện kỹ năng cũng như có thêm thời gian để suy nghẫm, áp dụng và thực hành, từ đó giúp bộ não lưu lại lâu hơn, sâu hơn về những mẫu câu mình đã đọc.\nTrước đây, chúng ta từng quan niệm rằng càng dành nhiều thời gian để học thì lượng kiến thức tiếp thu càng nhiều. Thực tế quan điểm ấy hoàn toàn sai lầm nhất là đối với những người học tiếng Anh giao tiếp, khi mà họ không có thời gian để thực hành, suy nghĩ và ghi nhớ dù bạn dành hơn 3 - 4 tiếng một ngày để học thì kiến thức vẫn bằng không.\nChính vì hiểu được thói quen này của đại đa số sinh viên Việt Nam, tác giả The Windy cho ra đời: 8 phút tự học tiếng Anh giao tiếp mỗi ngày như một cuốn cẩm nang bỏ túi, một gia sư hỗ trợ và một người bạn đồng hành, giúp các bạn hình thành ý thức tự học và tập trung học. Với khoảng thời gian 8 phút bỏ ra mỗi ngày, bạn có thể thu thập mẫu câu cần thiết, ghi nhớ chúng và ứng dụng chúng ngay. Cách học này giúp người dùng lưu lại sâu sắc cách thức đàm thoại, cần dùng trong trường hợp nào và dùng cho đối tượng nào. Điều đó thực sự sẽ khiến nâng cao khả năng giao tiếp mà không phải cuốn sách nào cũng làm được.\n",

Một số lượng khổng lồ các từ vựng vay mượn bắt nguồn từ tiếng Hán. Vì thế, nó là một môn học tương đối khó với ngưòi Việt. Muốn nói tiếng Nhật lưu loát, ngoài việc nắm vững ngữ pháp cơ bản, bạn nên dành thời gian tiếp xúc với người bản xứ. Khi nói sai, bạn phải nhận ra và tự mình sửa ngay. Nếu bạn có ý chí và ý thức được tầm quan trọng của nó, bạn sẽ không ngừng tiến bộ và đạt thành tích tối ưu.\nCuốn sách với cách trình bày đẹp mắt, súc tích và dễ hiểu, sẽ giúp bạn tăng cường khả năng:\n- Nắm vững văn phạm\n- Phát âm tiếng Nhật chuẩn xác\n- Hiểu và nói tiếng Nhật dễ dàng\n- Tự tin làm chủ tình huống\n- Phát triển các mối quan hệ\n- Dễ dàng áp dụng kiến thức vào học tập và kinh doanh\n",

    "description": "Tác giả Nguyễn Anh Đức chia sẻ về ý tưởng viết cuốn sách Luyện siêu trí nhớ từ vựng Tiếng Anh của mình: Trong chương trình đào tạo lãnh đạo của trường Kinh doanh Harvard, tác giả đã tình cờ gặp và kết bạn với một anh bạn người Do Thái. Qua tiếp xúc, tác giả từ ngạc nhiên đến tò mò bởi chàng trai này giao tiếp tiếng Anh thành thạo như một người bản ngữ, thậm chí khó tìm thấy được dấu hiệu tiếng Anh là chỉ là ngoại ngữ đối với chàng trai này. Tác giả đã rất tò mò, bởi có thể nói tiếng Anh như người bản ngữ như anh chàng này không nhiều. Câu trả lời của Shimon Yakir khiến tác giả rất bất ngờ: “ở Israel mọi người đều nói tiếng Do Thái và tiếng Ả- Rập là ngôn ngữ chính thức, nhưng hầu hết dân Israel đều nói tốt tiếng Anh và tiếng Đức, đấy còn chưa kể không ít người dùng tốt tới bốn hay có thể là năm ngôn ngữ khác nhau.”\nTại sao người Do Thái vẫn nói được tiếng Do Thái cổ của 2000 năm trước dù hàng nghìn thế hệ đã phải lưu vong, rồi sinh ra và chết đi ở nơi đất khách quê người?\nTại sao người Do Thái học và nói được nhiều ngoại ngữ một cách nhanh chóng và dễ dàng đến vậy? Và tại sao những đứa trẻ Do Thái lại có thể nói tới hai ba ngôn ngữ khác nhau một các tự nhiên và đơn giản như thế? Những câu hỏi như vậy luôn bao quanh suy nghĩ của tác giả, đã thôi thúc ông nghiên cứu và tìm hiểu về phương pháp học ngoại ngữ hiệu quả của dân tộc Do Thái.\nÔng mong muốn có thể truyền tải một cách đơn giản nhất cách mà người Do Thái học một ngôn ngữ mới thú vị thế nào, nó đầy sức mạnh tư duy và nhiều năng lượng sống tới người học tiếng Anh Việt Nam đang cảm thấy tiếng Anh luôn là áp lực. Chính tiếng Anh hiện nay đã cản trở vô số công việc thăng tiến và hạnh phúc của các bạn trẻ Việt.\nCuối cùng, tác giả đã khám phá ra bí mật học ngoại ngữ của dân tộc thông minh nhất Thế giới. Họ sử dụng các học khá đơn giản: đó là trộn tiếng mẹ đẻ với ngôn ngữ mới và họ muốn học. Điều này giúp ngôn ngữ mới không còn xa lạ nữa, luôn có cảm giác tò mò chủ động tìm hiểu ngôn ngữ mới đó như thế nào? Cách học này thực ra rất đơn giản và bất cứ ai cũng có thể áp dụng được, tác giả tin rằng người Việt Nam chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể làm được, thậm chí là thành công hơn thế!\nNhững điều không tưởng trước đây như học thuộc và nhớ lâu 100 từ vựng tiếng Anh mới mỗi ngày là điều không thể thì nay hoàn toàn có thể với phương pháp học tự tìm ra tính chủ động của bản thân này.\nCuốn sách được trình bày đưới dạng 13 chuyên đề tương ứng với 13 bí mật học ngoại ngữ của người Do Thái. Ngoài ra để kết hợp học hiệu quả cuốn sách đã được kết nối với 2 phương tiện hiện đại nhất trong cuộc sống của chúng ta đó là: online learning (học trực tuyến) và mobile learning(học trên điện thoại di động), người học nay đã dễ dàng hơn rất nhiều bởi có sự hỗ trợ của âm thanh, minh họa cùng với bối cảnh của từ vựng. Và để giúp người học áp dụng triệt để cuốn sách vào thực tiễn, tác giả đã áp dụng triệt để phương pháp học hiệu quả này vào nền tảng các chuyên đề của bài thi TOEIC. Người học sau khi áp dụng hoàn toàn có thể tự tin và thành công hơn ở môi trường làm việc mới.\nĐể giúp người học có thể hình dung cho mình được phương pháp học hiệu quả này, tác giả đặc biệt dành tặng mỗi cuốn sách 1 THẺ HỌC TRỰC TUYẾN CỦA SMARTCOM trị giá 150.000 đồng.\n\n",

    "description": "\"...Kết thúc muôn vàn khó khăn, sau khi tốt nghiệp phổ thông là thời kỳ tôi làm lái xe tải cho cửa hàng gỗ ép, các đồng nghiệp cười mỉa mai tôi và cho rằng tôi là kẻ thất học khi tôi không thể đọc được một từ tiếng Hán nào trên báo. Từ đó tôi bắt đầu học tiếng Hán với mong muốn mình không bị người khác coi thường. Tôi đã học hàng nghìn tiếng Hán và thành ngữ cổ điển đến mức gần như kiệt sức và thời gian trôi đi tôi có thể nghe hiểu được các ý kiến trên tờ báo Hán ngữ ở một mức độ nào đó. Vào khoảng thời gian đó tôi nhận lệnh nhập ngũ, khi sống trong quân ngũ những cuốn sách Hán ngữ đã săn sâu vào tâm trí tôi nhưng mẹ tôi lại khuyên tôi “con thử học tiếng Anh xem thế nào?”\nTiếng Anh ư? Tôi phải làm như thế nào đây? Lại đi học tiếng Anh vô điều kiện giống như tiếng Hán sao? Sau nhiều lần suy nghĩ tôi ra hiệu sách mua quyển từ vựng dành cho học sinh năm nhất trung học và không biết mục đích để làm gì. Và ngày qua ngày tôi bắt đầu học từ vựng tiếng Anh. Tuy nhiên, nếu bị coi là thất học bạn sẽ dũng cảm thừa nhận chứ? Tôi không quan tâm tới những ánh mắt nhìn xung quanh. Tôi tự nghĩ mình không biết nên cũng không mất cái gì và mình phải tự học tiếng Anh. Vì vậy dần dần tôi đã học hết các cuốn sách từ vựng của học sinh cấp hai, cấp ba theo thứ tự. Vốn dĩ lúc đầu tôi cũng không học được nhiều nhưng tôi cũng không từ bỏ. Bởi vì tôi không cho phép lòng tự trong của mình lại phải nghe thêm những lời nói coi thường của người khác nữa.\nSau khi xuất ngũ tôi lại tiếp tục làm lái xe ở cửa hàng gỗ ép và việc học tiếng Anh với tôi cũng không dễ dàng gì. Sau một thời gian, với vốn từ vựng hiện có của tôi, tôi cũng có chút tự tin và có thể giao tiếp được với người Mỹ ở một mức độ nào đó. Sự tự tin đó là nền tảng để tôi học các thành ngữ, tục ngữ tiếng Anh và việc học tiếng Anh ngày càng tiến bộ hơn. Sau đó tôi đã tham gia kỳ thi TOEFL và đạt được học bổng du học Mỹ bằng ngân sách của nhà nước. Và có được vị trí chuyên gia tiếng Anh như ngày nay.\nTôi đã từng làm bất kể công việc gì để kiếm sống ở Cheonggyecheon cho đến khi trở thành một chuyên gia dạy tiếng Anh cho người lao động. Có được nền móng vững chắc đó chính là nhờ việc học từ vựng tiếng Anh chứ không phải học cái gì khác. Để có thể biết được nhiều từ vựng tiếng Anh bạn luôn phải trau dồi và nâng cao vốn từ vựng nhiều hơn. Dù người yếu ngữ pháp cũng dần có khả năng phân tích tiếng Anh bởi vì kỹ năng viết tiếng Anh hết sức hữu ích. Nếu vậy, mỗi ngày học thêm từ vựng tiếng Anh sẽ góp phần trong việc học tiếng Anh đạt hiệu quả hơn. Tôi xin nhắc lại một điều rằng tôi là một người đã bắt đầu học tiếng Anh trong muôn vàn khó khăn. Chính vì vậy so với bất cứ ai tôi hiểu rất rõ tiếng Anh khó như thế nào và người học tiếng Anh cần điều gì nhất. Đại đa số mọi người học tiếng Anh đều có rất nhiều lo lắng nên tôi viết cuốn sách này để chia sẻ bí quyết học tiếng Anh với mọi người. Dù bạn đã là người thành công trong việc học tiếng Anh nhưng khi mới bắt đầu học bạn cũng sẽ có nhiều thiếu sót. Tôi đã phải chỉnh sửa cuốn sách này nhiều lần và tuyển chọn những từ mới thực sự cần thiết nhất cho tất cả những ai đang lo lắng về việc học tiếng Anh đều có thể học tiếng Anh căn bản. Bạn hãy cầm cuốn sách và chỉ cần học thuộc 1000 từ vựng tiếng Anh thì bạn có thể trở thành người Anh. Tôi mong rằng bạn sẽ trở thành một chuyên gia tiếng Anh trong tương lai không xa.\"\n(Woo Bo Hyun)\n",

Đây là một công trình nghiên cứ nhiều năm liền của một tác giả tâm huyết về nhiều vấn đề rất cần thiết cho những người đang học và sử dụng tiếng Anh trong công việc. Chẳng hạn sách sẽ phân tích sự khác biệt trong cách dung giữ close và shut, customer và client, find và discover… Khi nào thì dùng delay, khi nào thì dùng defer cùng để diễn tả nghĩa trì hoãn? Để diễn tả một sự việc xảy ra, ta dùng động từ happen, occur hay cụm từ take place? Khi nói về di trú, di cư,ta dùng emigration, immigration hay migration ? Nói về khoả thân thì dùng nake hay nude?... Rồi những từ đồng âm dị nghĩa thường bị nhầm lẫn như capital và capitol, counsel và council; die và dye; lesson và lessen… Những lúng túng trong việc sử dụng đại từ nhân xưng như He I và him and me; than I và than me…\nCác phần được chú trọng bao gồm các từ hay bị lẫn lộn, giải thích sự khác biệt, các vấn đề ngữ pháp, những sai sót trong phát âm. Từ điển bao gồm hai nội dung chính:\n1. The most commonly confused words (những từ thường nhầm lẫn hoặc bị dung sai nhiều nhất): Phần này chiếm dung lượng lớn.\n2. Grammar problems (Những vấn đề về ngữ pháp): Gồm những điểm chính yếu trong việc sử dụng các từ loại, các thì, các cấu trúc, các hành văn… Trong phần này, tác giả dựa vào nhiều tài liệu, sách báo xuất bản trong những năm đầu thế kỷ 21, kết hợp với việc so sánh, đối chiếu với các sách giáo khoa, từ điển để đưa vào đây những thay đổi về các quy luật ngữ pháp tiếng Anh cùng các hành văn thông dụng hiện nay.\nNgoài ra, từ điển cũng đề cập đến cách dùng tiếng Anh khi nói và viết về một số chủ đề thông dụng trong cuộc sống.\nCuốn từ điển này thích hợp cho những người đang học và sử dụng tiếng Anh ở trình độ từ trung cấp trở lên, các sinh viên, giáo viên tiếng Anh. Là công cụ tham khảo nên sách bao gồm thông tin từ nhiều cấp độ, từ những điểm đơn giản đến những vấn đề phức tạp nhất. Với những giải thích rõ ràng cùng với các ví dụ minh hoạ cuốn sách có thể giúp các giáo viên tra cứu, giải đáp những thắc mắc của học viên tiếng Anh.\nTiếng Anh ngày nay đã trở thành một ngôn ngữ giao dịch chính thống và cần thiết cho tất cả mọi người. Đối với người Việt Nam chúng ta, việc học và sử dụng tiếng Anh, việc sử dụng từ, cụm từ, ngữ pháp, cấu trúc câu tiếng Anh… thường gặp rất nhiều khó khăn và nhầm lẫn. Cuốn từ điển này sẽ giải quyết những khó khăn và nhầm lẫn đó.\nĐây là một công trình tâm huyết với mong ước sẽ giúp cho những người đang học, nghiên cứu và sử dụng tiếng Anh ở Việt Nam cũng như cộng đồng người Việt ở hải ngoại, đặc biệt là những bạn trẻ.\n“Lần đầu tiên, một cuốn từ điển về cách dung từ tiếng anh được một người Việt nam biên soạn rất thiết thực và hữu ích cho những người đang học, sử dụng và nghiên cứu tiếng Anh.”\n(BBT First News)\n",

Khó tìm thấy tài liệu phù hợp với khả năng thực tế của bản thân\nTrên thị trường hiện nay, có rất nhiều sách TOEIC dày đến 500 trang và mỗi bộ gồm có hai quyển: Listening và Reading. Tuy nhiên, tìm được quyển sách phù hợp với khả năng của bản thân bạn không phải là việc dễ dàng. Vì vậy, bộ sách này được chia thành 4 cấp độ: 520 điểm, 620 điểm 730 điểm và 860 điểm. Ở mỗi cấp độ là các nội dung trọng tâm tương ứng. Nhờ vậy, người học có thể lựa chọn giáo trình phù hợp với trình độ của mình.\nĐiểm yếu 3. Rất khó tự học trong một thời gian dài\nĐối với người có thời gian thì họ sẽ đến học tại một trung tâm ngoại ngữ nào đó, nhưng những người đã đi làm thì khó có thời gian rảnh rỗi. Tuy nhiên, vấn đề đó sẽ được giải quyết bằng bài giảng hình ảnh được cung cấp kèm theo tài liệu này. Hãy cố gắng hoàn tất lịch học trong 20 ngày với những giảng viên danh tiếng nhất của Gangnam và Songno.\nĐiểm yếu 4. Vì đã lâu không tham dự các kỳ thi lấy chứng chỉ quốc tế nên không có cảm giác thi thực tế\nDo không phải là sinh viên nên việc chịu đựng thời gian làm thi New TOEIC quả là một gánh nặng đối với nhân viên công sở. Chính từ thực tế này, sách với nội dung “TOEIC Know-how” nhằm giúp các bạn tự tin tham dự kỳ thi TOEIC, đồng thời trong phần phụ lục cũng có một bài kiểm tra mô phỏng thực tế. Nếu thực hành tốt tập tài liệu này, các bạn sẽ có đủ tự tin để tham dự kỳ thi TOEIC.\nNew TOEIC 4n4 giúp khắc phục điểm yếu chỉ trong 4 tuần.\n",

    "description": "Sức mạnh của cuốn sách này là có thể cuốn hút cả trẻ con cũng như người lớn. Trẻ con thì thấy giống quá, người lớn thì thấy nhớ quá...\nMột cuốn sách nặng, dày hơn 400 trang -kể ra là một thách thức không nhỏ trong thời buổi con người ta đang bị cuốn vào những lo toan kinh tế thường nhật. Nhưng nếu bạn đã lướt qua hình ảnh một chú nhóc thoạt đầu đã thấy siêu quậy trên trang bìa, lại chăm chú trước hai cái tên Goscinny và Sempé. Nhất là Goscinny, người đã sáng tạo ra Lucky Luke, những cuộc phiêu lưu của Astérix...\nTrò hờn dỗi luôn được nhóc Nicolas gào lên ở mọi lúc, mọi nơi khi nó gặp phải chuyện gì không vừa ý. Từ việc làn da đỏ au khi đi biển về không kiếm đâu bạn thân để ngắm, lần đầu tiên ăn cơm ở trường cảm giác đáng sợ làm sao, phải làm bài tập số học kinh hoàng đến thế nào, vì điểm “Không” môn Ngữ pháp nên bị cấm xem phim... cho tới hôm bài chính tả ít lỗi nhất lớp không được bố mẹ xem xét nghiêm chỉnh. Nhóc Nicolas lặp mãi bài ca: Nếu cứ bị mọi người ép sẽ phát chán mà bỏ nhà ra đi, sẽ bị chết và cả nhà tha hồ mà thương tiếc...\nNhưng Nicolas chẳng mấy khi thành công với trò ăn vạ đó, bởi nó bị bố mẹ lờ như không biết chuyện gì xảy ra. Nicolas cũng chẳng phật lòng, bởi ngay lập tức cu cậu tìm cho mình vô khối trò chơi mới. Đụng đâu cũng đổ vỡ, càng cố gắng ngoan càng làm hỏng nhiều việc. Như cái lần giúp Clotaine chuyển nhà, cả bọn đã phá tung các thùng đã nhét chặt đồ đạc bên trong khiến bố của Clotaine đành rút tiền tống chúng vào rạp xem phim. Chỉ vì thèm món bánh nhân táo, Nicolas buộc phải ngoan, bằng cách dẫu chơi bi thắng thằng bạn thân đành móc trả vì sợ nó gào lên mình sẽ bị phạt; bằng cách đành phải xé trang trong cuốn sách bà tặng, vì lỡ bố lên phòng bắt gặp sẽ đi đời món bánh táo; đến nỗi nó suýt oà khóc đã không được chơi chỉ tại “món bánh kem đểu cáng”. Còn lần nhóc tự dọn nhà cửa thì ôi thôi. Cái máy bay bay thử đã làm vỡ một cái bình ở phòng ăn. Lấy dao cạo điện của bố để cạo lông con gấu thì dao bị hỏng. Sắp xếp đồ chơi vào tủ thì không vừa nên nó vứt qua cửa sổ làm vỡ cái vòm kính. Muốn dọn đống kính vỡ thì làm hỏng tiếp máy hút bụi. Nổi hứng lau nhà nên làm vỡ cái liễn đẹp nhất của mẹ, chưa kể 2 cái đĩa và kèm theo là nước chảy lênh láng khắp nhà.\nNhững người lớn trong câu chuyện cũng quậy ra trò. Mẹ suốt ngày gào lên quá bức bối với chuyện suốt ngày phải lo cơm nước. Bố cũng hay cáu vì công việc quá bận rộn, về nhà lại phải giúp Nicolas làm môn số học và tập làm văn. Cũng tại bố tính kém nên thỉnh thoảng bài số học của Nicolas bị điểm “Không”. Thày giáo giám sát giờ ra chơi, sau một hồi ngắm nghía lũ trẻ nghịch cũng nhảy vào bày trò đến nỗi bị thôi việc. Bác hàng xóm Blédurt luôn tìm cách cãi cọ với bố, từ cuộc chơi bóng chày cho đến vụ ầm ĩ với cây kèn trompét. Cô giáo được tụi trẻ vô cùng yêu quý đành bất lực khi buổi xem xiếc bị gác giữa chừng vì lũ học trò không chịu ngồi im. Còn vụ dự giờ của các ông bố bà mẹ thành một cuộc tính nhẩm bài toán trên bảng, mà rất tiếc không có ai tìm ra đáp số đúng.\n48 mẩu truyện ngắn được sắp xếp trong 3 chương (quyển 1) giúp độc giả dễ theo dõi hơn những cuộc phiêu lưu gắn với hình ảnh đụng đâu hỏng đấy của nhóc Nicolas và các bạn. Làm quen với những đứa trẻ quậy như quỷ sứ ấy, bạn sẽ chợt có một tình cảm dịu êm vô bờ bến, một sự dịu dàng mà từ ấu thơ người ta vẫn dành cho người mình vô cùng yêu thương.\n",

    "description": "Ngày tình yêu không đến là cuốn sách về những câu chuyện tình yêu, tình bạn, gia đình hết sức bình dị, trong sáng, đầy yêu thương nhưng cũng chứa chan nỗi buồn, sự lo âu và cả những đắng cay đầu đời.\nTình yêu là thứ kì lạ nhất trên đời. Càng lớn, ta càng phải học cách đối mặt với những mối tình không tròn vẹn. Người ta có thể sẵn sàng bất chấp tất cả để yêu, cũng có thể bất chấp tất cả để ra đi. Nhưng dù với cớ gì, tuổi trẻ vẫn cứ luôn hoang hoải trong mình những dư âm từ những mối tình không đến đích.\nCuốn sách thấp thoáng bóng hình của một kẻ cô đơn, đang trên con đường khám phá chính mình, lao vào hạnh phúc và chạy trốn những cơn đau. Tình yêu của kẻ đó mong manh như những mảnh nắng cuối thu, cứ mải ngắm nhìn để rồi đến lúc chìa tay ra thì vệt nắng đã vội biến mất. Tình yêu, tình bạn hay gia đình cũng vậy, cứ mải loay hoay với những vụn vặt ích kỉ, những suy tư cá nhân để rồi quên đi những tháng ngày đáng lẽ phải dốc hết lòng yêu thương.\nHạnh phúc thoáng qua hay những nỗi buồn để lại sau mỗi câu chuyện, nhưng người ta không thấy trong đó sự chán chường, tuyệt vọng. Ở đâu đó trong khắc họa mỗi nhân vật, tác giả vẫn thắp lên những tia hi vọng về một ngày mai tươi sáng hơn. Giống như những nấc thang phải bước lên trong cuộc đời, tuổi trẻ phải học cách đối mặt với những yêu thương không tròn vẹn, để rồi biết mình cần phải được tỉnh táo hơn, nghiêm túc hơn, yêu và hi sinh nhiều hơn cho những người xứng đáng. Tình yêu có thể không đến cái đích như ta mong muốn, nhưng ta không chìm sâu trong những đau buồn của quá khứ để dằn vặt hiện tại, cay nghiệt hay rũ bỏ tương lai.\nMỉm cười với những câu chuyện tình yêu “hột mít” của lứa tuổi đôi mươi, thấp thỏm lo âu với cả hạnh phúc hay nỗi đau. Cũng có lúc người đọc lặng người đi với những cuộc chia ly không báo trước, con tim thì mỏng manh mà nỗi buồn thì tệ hại. Đó là tất cả những gì mỗi chúng ta phải trải qua. Đọc mỗi câu chuyện, người đọc dễ nhặt ra những tình tiết yêu đương mà chính mình ngày xưa cũng đã từng gặp phải, để rồi mỉm cười cho qua những tháng ngày ngô nghê, yêu thương thật thà không che giấu cảm xúc.\nNiềm vui có thể ngắn ngủi, nỗi buồn có thể kéo dài đến bao lâu, yêu thương có thể không đến như ta mong đợi, nhưng hãy cứ nhìn về phía trước, nơi bầu trời còn xanh và những tia nắng hi vọng vẫn còn đang lấp lánh.  Hãy cứ buồn, cứ yêu, chân thành và tha thiết.\n",

Đặc biệt, du học sinh Việt Nam tuy đứng thứ tư trong số các du học sinh tại Nhật (sau Trung Quốc, Hàn Quốc, Đài Loan) nhưng những năm gần đây lại có chỉ số gia tăng ngoạn mục nhất, xếp đầu tiên so với du học sinh đến từ các nước khác. Điều gì đã làm nên làn sóng mới này?\nĐầu tiên chắc chắn không thể không nhắc đến tình yêu và sự ngưỡng mộ dành cho xứ sở hoa anh đào vốn dĩ “đốn tim” teen từ văn hóa manga, anime rực rỡ, đến nền ẩm thực xinh đẹp của sushi, ramen, matcha, hay J-Pop và phong cách kawaii siêu đáng yêu…\nTừ năm 2008, chính phủ Nhật đã tuyên bố kế hoạch thu hút 300.000 sinh viên quốc tế vào năm 2020 bằng cách tạo ra vô vàn chính sách mở cửa cho du học sinh. Từ ngôn ngữ giảng dạy song song cả Anh - Nhật, các học bổng đa dạng, cũng như sự cải thiện hệ thống thi cử đầu vào, thủ tục tuyển sinh, thủ tục nhập cảnh vào Nhật Bản, chế độ việc làm sau tốt nghiệp… như một lời mời hấp dẫn đến sinh viên quốc tế.\n\nKỳ tích ở Nhật Bản\nNhắc đến đất nước Mặt Trời mọc này là nhắc đến vô vàn những kỳ tích. Và hành trình đến với nền giáo dục của đất nước này chắc chắn cũng sẽ tặng bạn những thành tích bất ngờ.\nQuyển sách này sẽ cung cấp những thông tin để bạn chắc chắn rằng Nhật Bản có phù hợp với mình không, và nếu đó là một điểm đến lý tưởng thì cần chuẩn bị gì, lên kế hoạch như thế nào và “tổng tiến công” để giành lấy một suất cất cánh cho mình ra sao. Dĩ nhiên, các \"lăn tăn\" về ngành học, trường học, chi phí, cuộc sống du học sinh… cũng sẽ được giải đáp rõ ràng, tỉ mỉ nhất qua những câu chuyện thực tế sống động.\nBên cạnh thông tin dày dặn về du học mà bất cứ bạn nào đang có ý định đến học tập tại đây cũng không nên bỏ qua, thì những teen đã và đang muốn đến Nhật Bản để du lịch, hay đơn giản là muốn tìm hiểu thêm về đất nước sở hữu quá nhiều những điều tuyệt vời này, chắc chắn muốn được sở hữu Nhật Bản có điều kỳ diệu.\n",

Xin giới thiệu đến bạn đọc ấn phẩm thứ hai đặc biệt dành cho tuổi teen của ông với tựa đề rất teen: GÁI XINH NỔI LOẠN. Vẫn là nhân vật Ly Cún, cô nữ sinh xinh đẹp và cá tính, nhưng lần này có thêm các cô gái teen xinh nữa: Mai Tồ, Nga Công Chúa, Thảo Mèo Con. Bốn cô gái 18 xinh đẹp đã nổi loạn. Nổi loạn mà vẫn ngoan. Ra khỏi nhà lúc nửa đêm bằng cách bám vào đường ống nước, nhảy múa với ‘trai lạ” (và đẹp) suốt đêm giao thừa. Thế nhưng nói như Lê Hoàng, như vậy không gọi là gái hư. Nhiều đứa con gái không đi đâu mà vẫn hư, thậm chí có đứa toàn ở nhà mà hư kinh khủng. Nếu bạn đọc nghĩ rằng các cô gái nổi loạn sẽ có nhiều điều \"ghê gớm” thì chắc chắn bạn đã nhầm. Lê Hoàng đủ thông minh để biết nên loạn đên đâu là vừa.\nGái xinh cần nổi loạn.\nKhi dám nổi loạn, gái xấu cũng thành xinh…\nLê Hoàng sẽ hấp dẫn bạn đọc từ đầu đến cuối với nhiều tình tiết éo le, gay cấn với giọng văn tưng tửng của mình.\n\"Đi đâu giờ này? Đi với ai? Đi tới bao giờ về? Có biết con gái đi đêm là hư lắm không?\nDạ không, thưa ba má. Con chỉ thấy nhiều đứa con gái chả hề đi đâu mà vẫn hư.Thậm chí, có đứa toàn ở trong nhà mà hư kinh khủng. Cho nên đêm nay con phải đi, mà con vẫn ngoan. Ngoan cần phức tạp như thế mới tuyệt vời.\"\n\"A, xử đẹp là xử như thế nào?\nXử đẹp là chặt trai ra làm nhiều khúc, khúc nào cũng đều tăm tắp như nhau, bỏ vào trong bao rất tiện.Hoặc xử đẹp là xử lúc trai đang hớn hở nhất, khiến cho tên đó quy tiên với một nụ cười.\"\n\"Cường thầm thì:\n- Hai ta sẽ nằm chung ư?\nLy Cún cao giọng:\n- Nằm chung. Nhưng vẫn không chung. Vì cách nhau một con cá sấu!\"\n",

    "description": "Nếu bạn đã yêu Cinder - một câu chuyện Cinderella được hiện đại hóa và được \"nâng cấp\" bằng yếu tố khoa học viễn tưởng, thì bạn chắc chắn sẽ vô cùng thích thú với phần tiếp theo: Scarlet – một câu chuyện cũng độc đáo, cũng cuốn hút, và cũng khiến tim bạn đập nhanh như vậy.\nCinder, cô thợ máy cyborg tuổi teen, đang ở trong tù và mới biết rằng mình chính là Công chúa Mặt Trăng Selene - người mà hầu hết mọi người đều tin rằng đã chết từ nhỏ trong một vụ \"tai nạn\". Thực tế, bà cô của Cinder là Nữ Hoàng Mặt Trăng Levana, luôn thèm khát quyền lực, đã lập kế hoạch trừ khử Cinder để chiếm được vai trò thống lĩnh, giờ đây muốn thâu tóm luôn cả Trái Đất, bắt đầu từ phía Đông Khối Thịnh Vượng Chung, đang được cai quản bởi Hoàng tử Kai. Cinder phải tìm cách thoát khỏi tù để giúp Kai ngăn chặn bà cô của mình. Tuy nhiên, cô cũng còn phải đối mặt với những khó khăn chồng chất khác, bởi còn có một đội quân chiến binh người sói biến đổi gene đang săn đuổi cô, và sẵn sàng tàn phá, gieo rắc nỗi kinh hoàng lên các thành phố lớn trên thế giới.\nThật may là Cinder không đơn độc. Cách cô nửa vòng Trái Đất là Scarlet Benoit, hay còn gọi là Cô bé Choàng Khăn Đỏ, đang tìm người bà mất tích của mình. Bà của Scarlet chính là người biết điều gì đó về những năm tháng còn nhỏ của Cinder. Scarlet và Wolf - một chiến binh đường phố - đã hợp lực với Cinder và những người cùng chí hướng với cô.\nĐiều tuyệt vời ở tập sách Scarlet là nó tiếp tục câu chuyện và những điểm mạnh của tập Cinder một cách rất mượt mà, bao gồm cả việc xây dựng thế giới trong truyện, \"nâng cấp\" và \"hiện đại hóa\" những nhân vật cổ tích quen thuộc với tất cả chúng ta một cách rất thông minh và thống nhất, cũng như cốt truyện vừa nhanh, vừa nhiều biến ảo phức tạp.\nĐiều quan trọng nhất là các nhân vật đều vừa sống vừa học, và tập cách hợp tác, hoạt động cùng nhau ngay cả khi chưa hoàn toàn tin tưởng nhau. Ở mặt này, họ giống những con người thật hơn là những siêu anh hùng, với cả những điểm mạnh và cả những khiếm khuyết, cả những tài năng và những thiếu sót. Các nhân vật nữ đều mạnh mẽ, đáng khâm phục, và nhiều nhân vật có những câu chuyện phía sau rất thú vị mà bạn phải đọc từ từ mới biết được.\nMột điểm cộng nữa là tác giả vừa khiến cho bạn căng thẳng, hồi hộp, nhưng vẫn thêm đủ sự hài hước cho câu chuyện để khiến bạn vẫn có thể thư giãn.\nNhận định\n“Trong tập 2, yếu tố khoa học viễn tưởng có phần nổi trội hơn yếu tố cổ tích, nhưng nội dung câu chuyện không vì thế mà kém phần hấp dẫn...”\n(The Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books)\n“Scarlet là sự kết hợp hoàn hảo của trí tưởng tượng phong phú, cộng thêm chút mưu đồ chính trị và sự lãng mạn. Bạn đọc sẽ bị đẩy vào thế giới tương lai nơi bạo lực, đặc biệt là sự kiểm soát và khống chế suy nghĩ của con người, hết lần này đến lần khác đẩy hai cô gái trẻ Cinder và Scarlet vào những tình huống nguy hiểm. Sau Lọ Lem và Cô bé quàng khăn đỏ, ai sẽ là nhân vật cổ tích tiếp theo trở thành cảm hứng của tác giả Meyer?”\n(Booklist)\n",

    "description": "Nhiều bài viết khá xúc động của bạn đọc về những kỷ niệm của mình gắn với sách của nhà văn Nguyễn Nhật Ánh, và khi đã mê những trang sách của nhà văn thì những câu chuyện, những nhân vật trong sách đã khiến nhiều bạn đọc lay động tâm hồn, giúp họ thay đổi suy nghĩ, quyết chí thay đổi cuộc đời bằng con đường học vấn, quyết chí phải san sẻ niềm yêu sách, yêu văn chương với thế hệ sau... Có những bạn đọc lấy cả tên nhân vật trong truyện để đặt cho con mình. Lại có những bạn đọc, nhờ đọc sách Nguyễn Nhật Ánh, mà đến với nhau thành vợ chồng\"\n(Thanh Kiều - Thể thao & Văn hóa)\nNguyễn Nhật Ánh vốn dĩ là một nhà văn rất đặc biệt, trải qua năm tháng những điều đặc biệt đó dần được hé lộ với công chúng. Cuốn sách Nguyễn Nhật Ánh Và Tôi sẽ đem đến cho người đọc những câu chuyện sâu sắc và đầy tính nhân văn rất thực.\n\"Từ khi đọc truyện của chú, tôi lại muốn đi học, muốn được cắp sách đến trường, được yêu đương, được vui đùa... chứ không muốn mãi mãi ở nhà nuôi gà nuôi lợn\". Từ \"nhận thức\" đó, Lê Mạnh Tân dũng cảm xin đi học lại, và sau khi học bổ túc cấp III, cậu đã thi vào Ðại học Mỹ thuật Hà Nội với số điểm cao, đến nay thì đã có gia đình và đang làm họa sĩ tự do.\nMột câu chuyện xúc động khác về bà mẹ nghèo bỏ quê Vĩnh Phúc vào TP.HCM kiếm sống, chắt chiu mua từng quyển truyện Nguyễn Nhật Ánh đã cũ sờn, bọc gói lại, gửi về quê cho con. Cô con gái ở quê đọc lời nhắn của mẹ, đọc truyện của Nguyễn Nhật Ánh mà lớn dần lên trong bối cảnh cả cha và mẹ đều tha phương kiếm sống. Nguyễn Thị Ngân, cô con gái của bà mẹ nghèo nhưng rất thương con và quý sách, nay đoạt giải nhì với bài viết Những trang sách ấu thơ.\nLại có câu chuyện của cô sinh viên từ Quảng Bình vào Huế học, vì mê truyện, dành thời gian đi \"lùng\" truyện Nguyễn Nhật Ánh mà gặp được người yêu cũng mê truyện Nguyễn Nhật Ánh. Và rồi hai người cưới nhau, đưa nhau về sống ở Ðồng Nai - câu chuyện Cảm ơn chú Nguyễn Nhật Ánh mai mối (giải ba) của Trần Thị Tuyết Mơ cũng có hậu như... truyện Nguyễn Nhật Ánh vậy.\n(Theo Tuổi Trẻ)\n\n",

Và mỗi chúng ta đều có cách lưu giữ kí ức về tuổi thơ là nhắc lại câu chuyện hồi bé với đám bạn thân, là lưu lại bằng những dòng chữ trong nhật ký hay mẩu truyện ngắn nào đó, nhưng với Pink thì khác, cô bé yêu thương tuổi thơ quá đỗi này chọn cho mình cách kể về tuổi thơ thật khác lạ: Vẽ tranh.\nNhật ký của Pink là tập truyện tranh gồm những mẩu chuyện hồn nhiên, với cách nhìn vừa đáng yêu, vừa mới lạ về tuổi thơ, về xe cộ, về mùa thu Hà Nội… Những điều tưởng chừng rất đời thường, hiển nhiên mà ai trong mỗi chúng ta đều đã từng trải qua, chỉ đến khi được tái hiện trên trang giấy với nét vẽ ngộ nghĩnh, đáng yêu của Pink - chúng ta mới chợt nhận ra rằng “Ồ thì ra những điều ngớ ngẩn vô cùng ấy chính là hạnh phúc!”\n \n\n“Tuổi thơ - quãng thời gian mà những người hơn ta chục tuổi tự cho mình cái quyền gọi ta là “trẻ con”… là những ngày lê la chơi ô ăn quan, đánh chắt đánh chuyền hay những chiều rong ruổi ngoài đồng… Ôi những ngày tháng “ngớ ngẩn” và hạnh phúc!\nNhật ký của Pink - không xoay quanh một nhân vật cụ thể nào với câu chuyện kể không đầu không cuối nhưng ai cũng có thể tìm thấy mình trong đó. Có thể nói Nhật ký của Pink nhưng không chỉ cho riêng Pink - cuốn Nhật ký này là cho bạn, cho tôi, cho tất cả mọi người.  Vốn dĩ nhật ký là vậy, là những dòng cảm xúc ngắt quãng của ấu thơ mà khi tình cờ đọc lại khiến ta cười hoan hỉ, có khi khiến ta rơi nước mắt rồi chợt mỉm cười quên đi những điều vụn vặt trong cuộc sống mà chìm đắm trong không gian tuổi thơ “ngớ ngẩn” và hạnh phúc của ngày xưa.\n\n \nĐặc biệt với 3 bộ bookcard do chính tay tác giả vẽ tặng bạn đọc có thể được dùng để cài vào bìa sách như dưới đây, vậy là mỗi chúng ta đều có một cuốn Nhật ký của riêng mình rồi đó!\n \n\n",

    "description": "Đỗ Nhật Nam của ngày hôm nay đã chững chạc hơn nhiều, mỗi lời nói và câu chữ của Đỗ Nhật Nam cũng đã thấy rõ toát ra từ một chàng trai chứ không hẳn là từ một cậu bé vô tư nữa. Từ dịch giả nhỏ tuổi nhất Việt Nam, Đỗ Nhật Nam đã trở thành tác giả viết tự truyện nhỏ tuổi nhất cả nước, và giờ đây, trên tay bạn là tác phẩm thứ 3 mang tên Bố mẹ đã cưa đổ tớ.\nBố mẹ đã cưa đổ tớ đến với bạn bất ngờ lắm đúng không? Cũng giống như hai cuốn sách trước của Đỗ Nhật Nam, càng đọc, chúng ta càng nhận ra, quyển sách, nếu xét ở góc độ nào đó, giúp ích cho những bạn cùng trang lứa một, thì giúp những ông bố bà mẹ mười. Cuốn sách giúp chúng ta sẽ hiểu sâu hơn hai chữ “thần đồng” của Đỗ Nhật Nam, thực chất chỉ có 1% tố chất của Nam được thừa hưởng gen trội từ bố mẹ, còn lại 99% đó là nỗ lực, rèn luyện bền bỉ, kiên trì, phối hợp hiệp đồng nhuần nhuyễn giữa ba người trong gia đình: Bố, mẹ, và Đỗ Nhật Nam.\nNhật Nam thật là đứa trẻ hạnh phúc có được hai bậc phụ huynh mẫu mực trong cách rèn con như vậy. Bằng giọng văn miêu tả chân thực, sinh động và đầy tình yêu thương con người, vạn vật xung quanh, chúng ta càng nhận thấy Nhật Nam quả là một đứa trẻ có tấm lòng nhân hậu, một cái tâm trong sáng.\nTiến sĩ Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng chia sẻ: “Khi có trong tay bản thảo, tôi không dám đọc ngay, tôi đợi một thời gian lắng xuống và vào một đêm yên tĩnh mới một mình ngồi “ngâm cứu”. Vốn được mệnh danh là “tiến sỹ văn hóa đọc” và chuyên đi giảng dạy về kỹ năng đọc siêu tốc nhưng nói thật, tác phẩm thứ 3 này của Nhật Nam đã được tôi đọc siêu chậm, chậm đến mức chắc chẳng còn ai đọc chậm hơn tôi. Tôi không đọc hết cuốn sách mà đọc làm 3 lần. Lần thứ nhất chỉ đọc về “Bố tớ”. Lần thứ 2 đọc về “Mẹ tớ”. Còn lần thứ 3, nói thật, là phải ngồi thiền một lúc mới bắt đầu để “Welcome tuổi dậy thì”. Tôi cũng khuyên bạn đọc đọc theo cách của tôi. Đảm bảo bạn sẽ rất thú vị…”\nChúc mừng bạn đã may mắn có trên tay cuốn sách thứ 3 của Đỗ Nhật Nam. Nguyện mong cuốn sách giá trị này đến với thật nhiều độc giả của đất nước 90 triệu dân Việt Nam ta.\n",

Để được hồn nhiên và vô tư, để có thể được cười ha hả bên bạn bè mình. Series Trường học có 1-0-2 với những câu chuyện cười ra nước mắt, chắc chắn sẽ khiến bạn phải nhấc điện thoại lên ngay và alo cho đứa bạn đã lâu không gặp: “Nhớ tụi bây quá”.Những câu chuyện vui nhộn “hài hước chết đi được”, của một lớp chuyên văn “danh giá” giỏi tất cả mọi thứ, trừ văn. Ở đó “chúng tôi là một lũ điên rồ đã nhận ra nhau và được số mệnh dồn vào cùng một xứ sở”.\nCâu chuyện về những đứa bạn thật ngầu và một vài “dạng bạn-cùng-bàn không thể tiêu hóa nổi” tại ngôi trường có 1-0-2 ấy, mỗi đứa bạn như một “phép lai bị hư”, “khiếm khuyết năng lực tế nhị”.\nCho đến một ngày nọ bạn “đau đớn” nhận ra: không phải “Chỉ có bạn thân mới nói cho bạn biết khi mặt bạn bị bẩn” mà là “Chỉ có bạn thân mới là đứa không thèm nói gì ngay cả khi nó đã bôi bẩn mặt bạn”. Dưới đây là một số dạng bạn-cùng-bàn không thể tiêu hóa nổi:\n“Kẻ lầm lì: thích nói chuyện với móng tay cáu bẩn hơn là tâm sự với bạn cùng bàn.\nKẻ ăn tạp: thỉnh thoảng giải trí trong lớp học bằng cách vo viên cục gỉ mũi và cho vào mồm.\nKẻ lưu manh: những kẻ “tăng động” mà bạn phải áp chế bằng compass, thước kẻ (bảng to, khổ bự) và thường xuyên là bằng móng tay của mình.\nKẻ hôi thối: Sử dụng nước hoa được tinh chế từ mắm, mồ hôi được ướp muối đậm đặc”.\nSau 11 năm “chùi mông trên ghế nhà trường”, kinh qua hầu hết những loại “tội phạm” bạn-cùng-bàn, phải đợi đến năm lớp 12 tác giả mới gặp một dạng bạn-cùng-bàn vô cùng nguy hiểm nhất.\nSeries Trường học có 1-0-2 với 9 câu chuyện vui nhộn về tuổi học trò: Những đứa bạn thật ngầu, Có một tin nhắn trên bảng, Vụ án ụp bị rác, Những chàng trai ở trường trung học, Bó hoa thần kỳ của cô giám thị, Lotion mùi dâu, Chiến binh cầu vồng, Chúng mình cãi nhau!, Mọi chuyện sẽ ổn thôi mà.\nTrường học có 1-0-2 được độc giả đón nhận nồng nhiệt ngay khi còn trích đăng từ kỳ trên “Tuổi mới” của Tập san Áo Trắng. Nhiều bạn đọc đã gửi thư về toàn soạn viết: “Ở đó, em gặp lại chính mình thời còn đi học. Đứa em gái em đang là học sinh cũng vồ lấy đọc nghiến ngấu, rồi cười ha hả suốt… Em tin rằng, tác giả hổi đi học hẳn phải là một học sinh… cá biệt thì mới có và nhờ nhiều kỷ niệm đến thế”.\n",

Hoàn cảnh xô đẩy Jamie ngày một thân thiết hơn với “kẻ-thù-hoàn-hảo”, nhưng thế vẫn chưa trớ trêu bằng việc tự dưng Hudson Rivers, chàng trai đẹp thứ tám trong khối, lại mời Angeline và Jamie đi ăn, mà KHÔNG mời Isabella.\nRồi bài tập viết nhật ký của thầy Evans với rất nhiều tự thú kinh ngạc, cuộc tuyển chọn thành viên cho ban nhạc của chính Jamie, triển lãm mỹ thuật, cuộc thi tài năng, dường như mỗi ngày trong cuốn Nhật ký Ngốc xít của Jamie đều là một chuyến phiêu lưu đầy kịch tính.

    "description": "Dẫn lối người đọc tìm về những khoảnh khắc tuổi thơ...\nKhông ai trong chúng ta không có một tuổi thơ. Bạn cũng có và tôi cũng có nhưng khác ở chỗ đó chính là lối dẫn về tuổi thơ của mỗi người.\nNhững Lối Về Ấu Thơ của Phạm Công Luận và Đặng Nguyễn Đông Vy mở cho ta nhiều lối về đầy thân quen, gần gũi: Hương vị Tết với bánh tét truyền thống, thịt kho hột vịt thơm lừng, hình ảnh của lũ trẻ xúm xít nhận tiền lì xì, và cũng thể là nỗi buồn trẻ thơ khi “ông bán bánh mì”  lúc nào cũng cắt miếng thịt to, chả to và cả lát ớt cũng to không còn bán trước cổng trường nữa…\nNhững Lối Về Ấu Thơ là tập hợp với 35 tản văn đầy thi vị, hồn hiên và nhẹ nhàng - đó là những khoảnh khắc đưa lối ta về với ấu thơ…\n“Như vậy, những món yêu thích hồi còn nhỏ ta ăn khôngchỉ bằng lưỡi, bằng miệng mà bằng cả tâm hồn, cảm xúc và tất nhiên bằng cả nhu cầu của một cơ thể đang lớn. Cái bánh nào ngon bằng bánh mẹ cho ta khi mới đi chợ về, được gói trong lớp giấy điều mỏng thấm loang vết dầu từ vỏ bánh. Chén cơm nào ngon bằng chén cơm ấm nóng trong một chiều mưa, sau một trận đá banh ngoài bãi cỏ gần nhà. Lúc ấy cơm ăn với cá,thịt, trứng chiên hay ba khía đều ngon…”\n(Trích Quà Vặt)\nMột người lớn lên ở thôn quê, một người sinh ra nơi phố thị, họ có những ký ức khác nhau nhưng cùng chung một nỗi nhớ chưa bao giờ nguôi về những ngày đã cũ. Tập tản văn “Những lối về ấu thơ” của hai tác giả Đặng Nguyễn Đông Vy - Phạm Công Luận đưa người đọc trở về với ký ức của chính họ: một Sài Gòn duyên dáng và thi vị của những ngày xưa cũ, một chốn quê nhà yên bình và man mác buồn. Nhưng những hình ảnh và cảm xúc tưởng như riêng tư ấy lại quen thuộc đến nỗi bất cứ ai trong chúng ta cũng có thể tìm thấy mình trong đó.\nNhẹ nhàng, nhẩn nha, nhưng không kém phần sâu sắc. Đôi lúc là một kỷ niệm thoáng qua, có khi lại là những ký ức rất cụ thể, hai giọng văn khác nhau hoà quyện thành một dòng chảy êm và mượt mà lạ lùng nhờ sự sắp xếp xen kẽ khá hợp lý của các bài viết. Sự hoà quyện và gắn kết đó có thể bởi cả hai tác giả đều là nhà báo, cũng có thể bởi họ là một đôi vợ chồng. Điều đặc biệt nhất của tập sách này là bạn có thể cảm nhận được tình yêu thương gia đình và không khí ấp áp của ngày Tết tràn ngập trong từng trang sách. Từ một cái Tết đơn sơ ở một vùng biển nghèo đến sự nhộn nhịp của Sài Gòn những ngày giáp Tết đều chan chứa tình người. Chính vì vậy, đây là cuốn sách thích hợp nhất để đọc trong những ngày này, khi gió Xuân đang tràn về trên khắp các nẻo đường phố thị.\n",

Thực tế cuộc sống ác nghiệt đến mức bóp tan tành và vùi dập giấc mơ của 1 đứa trẻ. Chấp nhận là chấp nhận thế nào???\nGiá mà, tất cả những nhà giáo, những người làm giáo dục có thể đọc được cuốn sách phi thường này…\nMọi công dân đều có quyền học hành (Hiến pháp Nước Cộng hòa Indonesia, Điều 33)\n©\nMột tác phẩm có tầm ảnh hưởng sâu rộng nhất Indonesia\n“Thầy Harfan và cô Mus nghèo khổ đã mang đến cho tôi tuổi thơ đẹp nhất, tình bạn đẹp nhất, và tâm hồn phong phú, một thứ gì đó vô giá, thậm chí còn có giá trị hơn những khao khát mơ ước. Có thể tôi lầm, nhưng theo ý tôi, đây thật sự là hơi thở của giáo dục và linh hồn của một chốn được gọi là trường học.” - (Trích tác phẩm)\n***\nTrong ngày khai giảng, nhờ sự xuất hiện vào phút chót của cậu bé thiểu năng trí tuệ Harun, trường Muhammadiyah may mắn thoát khỏi nguy cơ đóng cửa. Nhưng ước mơ dạy và học trong ngôi trường Hồi giáo ấy liệu sẽ đi về đâu, khi ngôi trường xập xệ dường như sẵn sàng sụp xuống bất cứ lúc nào, khi lời đe dọa đóng cửa từ viên thanh tra giáo dục luôn lơ lửng trên đầu, khi những cỗ máy xúc hung dữ đang chực chờ xới tung ngôi trường để dò mạch thiếc…? Và liệu niềm đam mê học tập của những Chiến binh Cầu vồng đó có đủ sức chinh phục quãng đường ngày ngày đạp xe bốn mươi cây số, rồi đầm cá sấu lúc nhúc bọn ăn thịt người, chưa kể sự mê hoặc từ những chuyến phiêu lưu chết người theo tiếng gọi của ngài pháp sư bí ẩn trên đảo Hải Tặc, cùng sức cám dỗ khôn cưỡng từ những đồng tiền còm kiếm được nhờ công việc cu li toàn thời gian ...?\nChiến binh Cầu vồng có cả tình yêu trong sáng tuổi học trò lẫn những trò đùa tinh quái, cả nước mắt lẫn tiếng cười – một bức tranh chân thực về hố sâu ngăn cách giàu nghèo, một tác phẩm văn học cảm động truyền tải sâu sắc nhất ý nghĩa đích thực của việc làm thầy, việc làm trò và việc học.\nTác phẩm đã bán được trên năm triệu bản, được dịch ra 26 thứ tiếng, là một trong những đại diện xuất sắc nhất của  văn học Indonesia hiện đại.\n***\nSơ lược về tác giả\nAndrea Hirata là nhà văn Indonesia ăn khách nhất từ trước đến nay. Tác phẩm đầu tay của ông, Chiến binh Cầu vồng (trong tiếng Indonesia là Laskar Penlangi) được dựa trên câu chuyện có thực về thời thơ ấu của chính nhà văn. Ngay từ lần xuất bản đầu tiên năm 2005, cuốn sách về ước mơ và cuộc đấu tranh bền bỉ của thầy trò trường Muhammadiyah để gìn giữ giáo dục cho chính mình đã đạt thành công vang dội.\nChiến binh Cầu vồng đã được chuyển thể thành phim điện ảnh, nhạc kịch và phim truyền hình. Bộ phim Chiến binh Cầu vồng đạt doanh thu cao kỷ lục ởIndonesia đồng thời giành được nhiều giải thưởng trong nước cũng như quốc tế.\nNhờ thành công của bộ phim và cuốn sách, lượng khách du lịch tới đảo Belitong đã tăng đột biến.\n",

    "description": "Crayon Shin-chan (tên tiếng Việt: Shin - Cậu bé bút chì) của tác giả Yoshito Usui, là một trong những bộ manga (truyện tranh) nổi tiếng của Nhật Bản. Được phát hành lần đầu năm 1991, bộ truyện sớm gây được tiếng vang trong bạn đọc Nhật Bản và ở nhiều nước khác. Vào năm sau đó, loạt phim hoạt hình về cậu bé Shin cũng được sản xuất, phát sóng liên tục cho đến tận bây giờ. Vì sao Shin - cậu bé bút chì lại hấp dẫn bạn đọc đến vậy?\nVề hình thức thể hiện, tác giả sử dụng một bút pháp đơn giản không tỉa tót, thậm chí có vẻ \"ngây ngô\" so với các bộ manga khác. Nội dung truyện cũng đơn giản: tất cả xoay quanh nhân vật chính là cậu bé Shin 5 tuổi với những mối quan hệ thân, sơ: bố mẹ, thầy cô, bạn bè, hàng xóm, người quen và cả người... không quen. Truyện diễn biến với tiết tấu chậm, dường như chỉ là những tình huống bình thường mà ta có thể bắt gặp ở bất kì đâu đó: ở nhà, ở trường, ngoài đường phố, nơi công viên, trong siêu thị... Mỗi tập truyện 120 trang, đơn giản từ hình thức đến nội dung... Nhưng cứ thử cầm lên xem, bạn sẽ không thể rời mắt khỏi cuốn sách cho đến những trang cuối cùng! Bằng tài năng kể chuyện, tác giả đã biến các trang sách của mình thành một sân chơi tràn ngập tiếng cười của những cô bé cậu bé hồn nhiên, và bạn đọc lớn, nhỏ khi cầm cuốn sách lên cũng bị hút vào sân chơi đó để cùng được sống, được cười với thế giới của trẻ nhỏ. Bên cạnh thủ pháp gây cười của tác giả, là nghệ thuật lồng ghép những bài học giáo dục vào trong từng tình huống truyện. Truyện của trẻ con, nhưng người lớn hãy cùng đọc, để nhận ra: Chúng ta còn hiểu biết quá ít về con trẻ! Có thể, Shin là một cậu bé rất hiếu động, đầy cá tính. Có thể, những trò tinh nghịch của Shin đôi khi quá trớn, chả chừa một ai (phải chăng ở đây cũng có sự tương đồng nào đó với những nhân vật dân gian hài hước Việt Nam?). Nhưng đằng sau những tình huống dở mếu dở cười do Shin gây ra, lại là những bài học nhẹ nhàng mà cũng thật thấm thía: người lớn thấy mình phải sâu sát với trẻ hơn, và các bạn đọc nhỏ tuổi chắc chắn cũng có dịp nhìn nhận lại mình, để thấy cái gì hay và không hay, trong gia đình cũng như ngoài xã hội...\n",

Cuộc đời thật lạ… và tình yêu còn trớ trêu hơn… Định mệnh đưa đẩy hai người đến với nhau, không bằng cách này thì bằng cách khác, để rồi họ đem lòng yêu nhau, yêu một cách say đắm… tưởng chừng mãi không thể rời xa được. Nhưng cuộc đời là một chuỗi những rắc rối, những trắc trở không êm ái như thảm trải đầy hoa hồng. Vậy nên, điều gì đến cũng sẽ đến…\n \n\n",

    "description": "Crayon Shin-chan (tên tiếng Việt: Shin - Cậu bé bút chì) của tác giả Yoshito Usui, là một trong những bộ manga (truyện tranh) nổi tiếng của Nhật Bản. Được phát hành lần đầu năm 1991, bộ truyện sớm gây được tiếng vang trong bạn đọc Nhật Bản và ở nhiều nước khác. Vào năm sau đó, loạt phim hoạt hình về cậu bé Shin cũng được sản xuất, phát sóng liên tục cho đến tận bây giờ. Vì sao Shin - cậu bé bút chì lại hấp dẫn bạn đọc đến vậy?\nVề hình thức thể hiện, tác giả sử dụng một bút pháp đơn giản không tỉa tót, thậm chí có vẻ \"ngây ngô\" so với các bộ manga khác. Nội dung truyện cũng đơn giản: tất cả xoay quanh nhân vật chính là cậu bé Shin 5 tuổi với những mối quan hệ thân, sơ: bố mẹ, thầy cô, bạn bè, hàng xóm, người quen và cả người... không quen. Truyện diễn biến với tiết tấu chậm, dường như chỉ là những tình huống bình thường mà ta có thể bắt gặp ở bất kì đâu đó: ở nhà, ở trường, ngoài đường phố, nơi công viên, trong siêu thị... Mỗi tập truyện 120 trang, đơn giản từ hình thức đến nội dung... Nhưng cứ thử cầm lên xem, bạn sẽ không thể rời mắt khỏi cuốn sách cho đến những trang cuối cùng! Bằng tài năng kể chuyện, tác giả đã biến các trang sách của mình thành một sân chơi tràn ngập tiếng cười của những cô bé cậu bé hồn nhiên, và bạn đọc lớn, nhỏ khi cầm cuốn sách lên cũng bị hút vào sân chơi đó để cùng được sống, được cười với thế giới của trẻ nhỏ. Bên cạnh thủ pháp gây cười của tác giả, là nghệ thuật lồng ghép những bài học giáo dục vào trong từng tình huống truyện. Truyện của trẻ con, nhưng người lớn hãy cùng đọc, để nhận ra: Chúng ta còn hiểu biết quá ít về con trẻ! Có thể, Shin là một cậu bé rất hiếu động, đầy cá tính. Có thể, những trò tinh nghịch của Shin đôi khi quá trớn, chả chừa một ai (phải chăng ở đây cũng có sự tương đồng nào đó với những nhân vật dân gian hài hước Việt Nam?). Nhưng đằng sau những tình huống dở mếu dở cười do Shin gây ra, lại là những bài học nhẹ nhàng mà cũng thật thấm thía: người lớn thấy mình phải sâu sát với trẻ hơn, và các bạn đọc nhỏ tuổi chắc chắn cũng có dịp nhìn nhận lại mình, để thấy cái gì hay và không hay, trong gia đình cũng như ngoài xã hội...\nMời các bạn đón đọc!\n",

    "description": "Nếu như có thể so sánh, thì trái tim cô cậu học trò nhỏ mười mấy tuổi như một cái cây, một cái cây đang lớn, mạnh mẽ, nhiệt thành, xinh xắn, căng tràn yêu đời, căng tràn nhựa sống, nhưng cũng có lúc lại man mác, như một chiếc lá lộc vừng lặng lẽ rơi. Với những câu chuyện trong sáng, nhẹ nhàng của lứa tuổi học trò, cuốn sách Như lá lộc vừng xoay trong gió sẽ khiến bạn thấy thú vị vì tìm được chính mình trong đó, và bồi hồi nhớ về những cảm xúc của một thời như gần, như xa.\nCô gái nhỏ âý thích nhắn tin, thích vào mạng, nhưng biết chẳng có tin nhắn, email, cuộc gọi hay comment nào trên thế giới ảo có thể thay thế cho một nụ cười dịu dàng, một ánh mắt nhìn sâu, một cái chạm gần, một vòng tay ấm…Cậu trai ấy thích được ngồi bên cạnh bạn bè, để kể cho nhau nghe vài câu chuyện vu vơ, bất chợt hỏi nhau vài câu ngắn ngủi, cười phá lên bởi một câu chuyện người ngoài chẳng thể nào hiểu nổi... hay đơn giản chỉ là im lặng và cùng nhìn về một hướng, cảm thấy khoảnh khắc này dịu dàng biết bao.\n“Như lá lộc vừng xoay trong gió” là bức tranh kỷ niệm được vẽ bằng ghế đá, hàng cây, bằng những con đường nhỏ, bằng tiếng cười giòn giã của bạn bè, bằng những bịch bánh tráng me chia nhau nho nhỏ... Đó là những ký ức của quá khứ, hiện tại, tương lai, mà tất thảy chúng ta đều đã và đang có, khi khoác trên người tấm áo học sinh trắng ngần.“Như lá lộc vừng bay trong gió” chứa những câu chuyện trong sáng, nhẹ nhàng của lứa tuổi học trò. Phong cách viết dung dị, dí dỏm, đáng yêu.

Luôn có những ngăn bí mật mới hàng ngày mở ra cánh cửa nhỏ, đón nhận những cảm xúc mới mẻ tinh khôi, dành cho những người mới bước vào cuộc sống của bạn…\nBạn sẽ ngạc nhiên sao mình có thể yêu nhiều đến thế!

Bởi tôi biết sức chứa của trái tim bạn là vô tận. Có thể bao nhiêu bận bịu lo toan của thế giới người lớn sẽ cuốn chúng ta đi. Bạn chẳng thể gặp gỡ, thậm chí gọi điện cho tôi mỗi ngày. Nhưng chỉ cần đôi khi nghĩ đến tôi và mỉm cười, chiếc lá của tôi trong trái tim bạn sẽ chẳng bao giờ rụng xuống, sẽ mãi xanh tươi...!” ...\n",

    "description": "ĐÁNH GIÁ TỪ TIKI.VN: Socrates In Love là câu chuyện về tình yêu học trò trong sáng, thanh thuần, sống động và chân thực của tuổi mười bảy. Socrates In Love không có những khoảnh khắc bùng nổ của cảm xúc, cũng không có những ghen tuông hờn giận dữ dội của tình yêu, lại càng không có tính toán so đo được mất. Socrates In Love nhẹ nhàng như dòng suối mát trôi lững lờ trong mỗi cuộc đời với mối tình đầu đẹp đẽ, với những rung động tuy nhỏ, nhưng chứa đầy sự ngây ngô của tuổi trẻ lần đầu biết yêu. Không gian của truyện trong trẻo, vương một nỗi buồn man mác với cái kết trắc trở. Tất cả e thẹn, băn khoăn, thậm chí lời tỏ tình non nớt, ngượng ngùng đều chỉ là quá khứ - một quá khứ tưởng như thật xa mà cũng như thật gần, vì Aki đã đi rồi, bệnh ung thư đã đoạt mất Aki của Saku, và còn lại, là hồi ức của một trái tim yêu, của tiếng gọi tình yêu còn đang vang vọng trong cuộc sống. Socrates In Love thích hợp để thưởng thức cùng một tách trà trong không gian yên tĩnh, để ta cảm nhận những khoảnh khắc rung động mà mỗi người đều đã trải qua nhưng không mấy ai còn nhớ. Rung động ấy, tiếng gọi ấy có thể mờ nhạt, có thể tiếc nuối, có thể đầy ám ảnh nhưng đều là tình yêu. ©\nCuốn sách kể lại những ký ức sống động, ngọt ngào nhưng đau đớn của Sakutaro với người bạn gái thời trung học. Mối tình đầu giữa Sakutaro và Aki đến tự nhiên như trời định, họ sinh ra để bên nhau, thành đôi thành lứa. Họ khởi đầu như đôi bạn cán sự của lớp học, là hai học sinh được chọn đóng Romeo và Juliet, cùng chia sẻ cuốn nhật ký… cho tới khi nhận ra rằng tình yêu trong sáng đã bắt đầu từ khi nào chẳng rõ. Tình cảm quyến luyến của họ hiển nhiên như bảng đen và bình hoa trong lớp, êm đềm trôi theo năm tháng học trò… Nhưng, thần nụ cười không cho họ đi tới trọn con đường, Aki đã mãi mãi dừng lại ở tuổi mười bảy, và Sakutaro bước tiếp - chỉ còn lại một mình… \"Có đôi lúc, vào một buổi sáng, ta bỗng vô tình tìm thấy thứ mà mình đã đánh mất từ rất lâu ở đúng chỗ trước kia. Trông nó thậm chí còn mới hơn cả trước khi bị đánh mất. Tựa như có một người không quen biết cẩn thận cất giữ nó giùm ta. Liệu có khi nào linh hồn của Aki sẽ quay trở về đây tựa như cách ấy không?\" Socrates in love đưa người đọc tới thế giới kỷ niệm đầy ắp những cung bậc cảm xúc - lãng mạn và chua xót, tha thiết và day dứt của Sakutaro – và ở đó, người ta có thể thấy tình yêu đã vượt qua danh giới của sự sống và cái chết, hiện tại và tương lai…Không chỉ là cuốn sách lãng mạn dành cho độc giả mới lớn, Socrates in love là câu chuyện giản dị, sâu sắc, xúc động về tình yêu và hành trình vượt qua những nỗi đau đầu đời. Em đang nói bên tai tôi. Bằng cái giọng thẹn thùng quen thuộc ấy. Trái tim dịu dàng của em đâu mất rồi? Những gì đẹp đẽ, cao thượng và tinh tế trong cái con người có tên Aki đâu mất rồi? Phải chăng chúng vẫn đang lao đi vô định dưới những vì sao lấp lánh tựa như đòan tàu lướt trên một bình nguyên phủ đầy tuyết trong đêm? Theo một phương vị mà mọi chuẩn mực của thế giới này không thể đo đếm được?\n...\n\nMời các bạn đón đọc!\n",

Lẽ dĩ nhiên như cuộc đời, có đâu đó những mưu toan nhỏ nhen, những trò chơi bẩn… không đáng mặt anh hào. Nhưng…. (chữ nhưng dành cho sự khám phá của các bạn)\n“Chưa tới ba giờ chiều, trời còn nắng chang chang, các cầu thủ của hai đội “Mũi tên vàng” và “Sư tử” đã tới ngồi chầu rìa cạnh sân bóng phường 2, chờ tới lượt mình. Thời gian gần đây nhờ sự can thiệp của anh Long, các cầu thủ hè phố này đã được xếp lịch tập dượt tại sân bóng “người lớn” từ ba đến năm giờ chiều trong các ngày thứ hai và thứ sáu mỗi tuần.\nCòn chiều thứ năm thì tuỳ theo tình hình sân bãi, các chú nhóc có thể được sắp xếp đá “ké” vào giữa hai cữ dượt của các đội bóng thanh niên. Những nạn nhân đau khổ cư ngụ hai bên cửa hàng bách hóa thoạt đầu không hiểu sự tình làm cho mà “lũ tiêu yêu” biến mất đột ngột như vậy và sau đó dĩ nhiên là họ rất thích thú khi biết Đoàn thanh niên phường đã giải quyết được tụ điểm sinh hoạt cho các chú bé hiếu động.\nTrong khi đó thì “lũ tiểu yêu” đã dời địa bàn hoạt động của mình về sân bóng của phường, cũng với một sự thích thú không kém. Thực ra, cái sân bóng này chỉ mới được thành lập cách nay khoảng ba tháng. Đoàn viên thanh niên trong phường được huy động, với cuốc xẻng trên tay, san phẳng một bãi đất trống vốn trước đay là một trại nuôi gà công nghiệp bị bỏ hoang làm sân vận động. Trong vòng một tuần, cái miếng đất lớn đó đã được cải tạo thành một sân bóng đàng hoàng. Vừa ra đời xong, sân bóng đã chứng minh ngay sự đóng góp của mình. Các đội bóng thanh niên, sau đó là các đội bóng lão tướng, và sau đó nữa là các đội bóng thiếu nhi đã lần lượt được phân giờ giấc tập luyện ở đó. Từ sớm tinh mơ đến sâm sẩm tối, sân bóng nhôn nhịp kẻ ra người vào.\nCác cầu thủ của hai đội “Mũi tên vàng” và “Sư tử” đặc biệt yêu mến sân bóng “của mình”. Ở đây, trên mảnh đất thân thương này, chúng có thể đá thẳng giò thẳng cẳng mà không phải thấp thỏm nhìn theo trái bóng vô kỷ luật đang lao đầu vô cánh cửa kiếng của một chiếc xe hơi chạy bằng đôi mắt sợ hãi. Ôi, ai mà chẳng sung sướng khi đuổi theo bóng thoả thích mà không phải lo lắng chuẩn bị quơ giầy dép, quần áo chạy toé khói nếu chẳng may trái bóng lỡ chui vô một khung cửa nào đó bên đường ...\" Một trích đoạn của Trước Vòng Chung Kết\"\n",

Vào năm sau đó, loạt phim hoạt hình về cậu bé Shin cũng được sản xuất, phát sóng liên tục cho đến tận bây giờ. Vì sao Shin - cậu bé bút chì lại hấp dẫn bạn đọc đến vậy?\nVề hình thức thể hiện, tác giả sử dụng một bút pháp đơn giản không tỉa tót, thậm chí có vẻ \"ngây ngô\" so với các bộ manga khác. Nội dung truyện cũng đơn giản: tất cả xoay quanh nhân vật chính là cậu bé Shin 5 tuổi với những mối quan hệ thân, sơ: bố mẹ, thầy cô, bạn bè, hàng xóm, người quen và cả người... không quen.

Bằng tài năng kể chuyện, tác giả đã biến các trang sách của mình thành một sân chơi tràn ngập tiếng cười của những cô bé cậu bé hồn nhiên, và bạn đọc lớn, nhỏ khi cầm cuốn sách lên cũng bị hút vào sân chơi đó để cùng được sống, được cười với thế giới của trẻ nhỏ. Bên cạnh thủ pháp gây cười của tác giả, là nghệ thuật lồng ghép những bài học giáo dục vào trong từng tình huống truyện. Truyện của trẻ con, nhưng người lớn hãy cùng đọc, để nhận ra: Chúng ta còn hiểu biết quá ít về con trẻ! Có thể, Shin là một cậu bé rất hiếu động, đầy cá tính. Có thể, những trò tinh nghịch của Shin đôi khi quá trớn, chả chừa một ai (phải chăng ở đây cũng có sự tương đồng nào đó với những nhân vật dân gian hài hước Việt Nam?). Nhưng đằng sau những tình huống dở mếu dở cười do Shin gây ra, lại là những bài học nhẹ nhàng mà cũng thật thấm thía: người lớn thấy mình phải sâu sát với trẻ hơn, và các bạn đọc nhỏ tuổi chắc chắn cũng có dịp nhìn nhận lại mình, để thấy cái gì hay và không hay, trong gia đình cũng như ngoài xã hội...\n* Ảnh bìa minh họa.\nDự kiến phát hành 02/2012\n",

    "description": "Cuốn Đi Qua Hoa Cúc là tập truyện dài của Nguyễn Nhật Ánh, mở đầu câu truyện tác giả kể lại tuổi ấu thơ hồn nhiên của nhân vật trong truyện, kết hợp với tả cảnh ở miền quê, những ngôi nhà nằm dọc hai bên đường đá sỏi dọc theo hai bên hàng dâm bụt và cả cây sứ cây bàng tỏa bóng mát, tỏa hương thơm trước sân nhà. Một nét vẽ nên thơ thật đầm ấm ở một vùng quê xa xôi tác giả dường như làm ấm lòng cho người đọc. Thật vậy mỗi cốt truyện của Nguyễn Nhật Ánh đã phác họa lên một nét quê hương ngọt ngào, một thời ấu thơ đẹp, một tình yêu của tuổi học trò cũng hòa lẫn tình yêu khát khao của bao lứa tuổi. Cuốn truyện dài Đi Qua Hoa Cúc là một trong những tác phẩm tuyệt tác hay của tác giả làm thôi thúc người đọc thêm nhiều ấn tượng và sự lôi cuốn tràn dâng trong lòng bạn đọc\n\"Trước nhà bà nội tôi có một cây bàng cao thật cao. Mỗi lần về thăm nội, khi chiếc xe gobel của ba tôi ngoặt quanh cái giếng đá đầu làng, bao giờ tôi cũng nhấp nhổm ở yên sau và hồi hộp ngước mắt trông lên. So với dãy hàng rào dâm bụt của những ngôi nhà nằm dọc hai bên con đường đá sỏi, kể cả ngọn sầu đông và cây sứ trắng toả hương thơm nức mũi trước sân nhà bà tôi lúc nào cũng vươn cao sừng sững. Khi nhìn lên, hễ thấy tán bàng xanh um kia hiện ra trong tầm mắt như một chấm đen mỗi lúc một lớn dần, tôi biết ngay đã sắp đến nhà bà. Và thế là tôi không nén nổi nụ cười sung sướng. Và cả e thẹn nữa, chẳng hiểu vì sao. Những lúc đó, bao giờ tôi cũng úp mặt vào lưng ba tôi để giấu đi nỗi xao xuyến của mình. Cũng như vậy, trước ngõ nhà ông ngoại tôi là một hàng rào hoa giấy đỏ. Hoa không thẫm, chỉ đỏ hồng. Vì trồng lâu năm nên cây uốn lượn chằng chịt, gốc nào gốc nấy to bằng bắp chân người. Hoa rực rỡ từng chùm, từng nhánh, phủ kín cả hai trụ cổng bằng đá ong lâu ngày lên rêu xanh mướt. Quê nội tôi thuộc một làng miền núi. Quê ngoại tôi ở miệt đồng bằng. Nhà ông tôi ở cách đường quốc lộ non một cây số về phía biển. Nhưng vì không bị cây cối che khuất nên đứng trên đường người ta vẫn có thể trông thấy rõ mồn một vừng hoa đỏ ối dưới kia. Sau này, khi đã đi xa, mỗi lần về thăm ngoại, tôi ngồi trên xe đò băng qua cầu Cẩm Lễ, mắt nôn nao ngóng về phía biển, hễ thấy hoa đỏ vẫy tay là biết đã tới nhà.\"\n",

    "description": "Cô gặp anh trong lúc đang túng quẫn, cùng đường. Từ đó, vận mệnh đã lặng lẽ thay đổi. Vốn liếng nguyên thủy nhất của thiếu nữ đang độ thanh xuân giống những đồng xèng trên canh bạc vận mệnh.\nHiện thực muôn vàn khó khăn đã khiến cô quyết định dùng những đồng xèng này để đổi lấy cơ hội tiếp tục học hành. Đây vốn chỉ là một cuộc giao dịch vật chất nhưng một cách vô thức, trong trái tim cô đã dần chan chứa bóng hình anh.\nCô không biết tại sao mình lại thích anh, mà thích một người, đâu cần lý do. Cảm giác rung động tinh tế này đơn giản chỉ là tình cảm không thể kìm nén. Trong lúc anh suy sụp, cuộc đời giống một trời đầy tuyết, cô đã nguyện làm lò sưởi ấm áp, làm tan chảy giá lạnh trong anh…\nTrong cuộc sống, có lẽ thực sự cần đến chữ “duyên”. Mặc dù ban đầu, anh chỉ là sự lựa chọn trong lúc túng quẫn cùng đường của cô, nhưng thực ra, số phận đã lặng lẽ an bài tất cả. “Số phận đã định” - Lam Tố Hinh vô cùng tin tưởng vào bốn chữ này. Ngoài điều này ra thì không gì có thể giải thích được cho sự gặp gỡ giữa cô và Anh Hạo Đông.\n",

    "description": "Sức mạnh của cuốn sách này là có thể cuốn hút cả trẻ con cũng như người lớn. Trẻ con thì thấy giống quá, người lớn thì thấy nhớ quá...\nMột cuốn sách nặng, dày hơn 400 trang -kể ra là một thách thức không nhỏ trong thời buổi con người ta đang bị cuốn vào những lo toan kinh tế thường nhật. Nhưng nếu bạn đã lướt qua hình ảnh một chú nhóc thoạt đầu đã thấy siêu quậy trên trang bìa, lại chăm chú trước hai cái tên Goscinny và Sempé. Nhất là Goscinny, người đã sáng tạo ra Lucky Luke, những cuộc phiêu lưu của Astérix...\nTrò hờn dỗi luôn được nhóc Nicolas gào lên ở mọi lúc, mọi nơi khi nó gặp phải chuyện gì không vừa ý. Từ việc làn da đỏ au khi đi biển về không kiếm đâu bạn thân để ngắm, lần đầu tiên ăn cơm ở trường cảm giác đáng sợ làm sao, phải làm bài tập số học kinh hoàng đến thế nào, vì điểm “Không” môn Ngữ pháp nên bị cấm xem phim... cho tới hôm bài chính tả ít lỗi nhất lớp không được bố mẹ xem xét nghiêm chỉnh. Nhóc Nicolas lặp mãi bài ca: Nếu cứ bị mọi người ép sẽ phát chán mà bỏ nhà ra đi, sẽ bị chết và cả nhà tha hồ mà thương tiếc...\nNhưng Nicolas chẳng mấy khi thành công với trò ăn vạ đó, bởi nó bị bố mẹ lờ như không biết chuyện gì xảy ra. Nicolas cũng chẳng phật lòng, bởi ngay lập tức cu cậu tìm cho mình vô khối trò chơi mới. Đụng đâu cũng đổ vỡ, càng cố gắng ngoan càng làm hỏng nhiều việc. Như cái lần giúp Clotaine chuyển nhà, cả bọn đã phá tung các thùng đã nhét chặt đồ đạc bên trong khiến bố của Clotaine đành rút tiền tống chúng vào rạp xem phim. Chỉ vì thèm món bánh nhân táo, Nicolas buộc phải ngoan, bằng cách dẫu chơi bi thắng thằng bạn thân đành móc trả vì sợ nó gào lên mình sẽ bị phạt; bằng cách đành phải xé trang trong cuốn sách bà tặng, vì lỡ bố lên phòng bắt gặp sẽ đi đời món bánh táo; đến nỗi nó suýt oà khóc đã không được chơi chỉ tại “món bánh kem đểu cáng”. Còn lần nhóc tự dọn nhà cửa thì ôi thôi. Cái máy bay bay thử đã làm vỡ một cái bình ở phòng ăn. Lấy dao cạo điện của bố để cạo lông con gấu thì dao bị hỏng. Sắp xếp đồ chơi vào tủ thì không vừa nên nó vứt qua cửa sổ làm vỡ cái vòm kính. Muốn dọn đống kính vỡ thì làm hỏng tiếp máy hút bụi. Nổi hứng lau nhà nên làm vỡ cái liễn đẹp nhất của mẹ, chưa kể 2 cái đĩa và kèm theo là nước chảy lênh láng khắp nhà.\nNhững người lớn trong câu chuyện cũng quậy ra trò. Mẹ suốt ngày gào lên quá bức bối với chuyện suốt ngày phải lo cơm nước. Bố cũng hay cáu vì công việc quá bận rộn, về nhà lại phải giúp Nicolas làm môn số học và tập làm văn. Cũng tại bố tính kém nên thỉnh thoảng bài số học của Nicolas bị điểm “Không”. Thày giáo giám sát giờ ra chơi, sau một hồi ngắm nghía lũ trẻ nghịch cũng nhảy vào bày trò đến nỗi bị thôi việc. Bác hàng xóm Blédurt luôn tìm cách cãi cọ với bố, từ cuộc chơi bóng chày cho đến vụ ầm ĩ với cây kèn trompét. Cô giáo được tụi trẻ vô cùng yêu quý đành bất lực khi buổi xem xiếc bị gác giữa chừng vì lũ học trò không chịu ngồi im. Còn vụ dự giờ của các ông bố bà mẹ thành một cuộc tính nhẩm bài toán trên bảng, mà rất tiếc không có ai tìm ra đáp số đúng.\n48 mẩu truyện ngắn được sắp xếp trong 3 chương (quyển 1) giúp độc giả dễ theo dõi hơn những cuộc phiêu lưu gắn với hình ảnh đụng đâu hỏng đấy của nhóc Nicolas và các bạn. Làm quen với những đứa trẻ quậy như quỷ sứ ấy, bạn sẽ chợt có một tình cảm dịu êm vô bờ bến, một sự dịu dàng mà từ ấu thơ người ta vẫn dành cho người mình vô cùng yêu thương.\n",

Đấy là một ngôi trường kỳ lạ, lớp học thì ở trong toa xe điện cũ, học sinh thì được thoả thích thay đổi chỗ ngồi mỗi ngày, muốn học môn nào trước cũng được, chẳng những thế, khi đã học hết bài, các bạn còn được cô giáo cho đi dạo. Đặc biệt hơn ở đó còn có một thầy hiệu trưởng có thể chăm chú lắng nghe Totto-chan kể chuyện suốt bốn tiếng đồng hồ! Chính nhờ ngôi trường đó, một Totto-chan hiếu động, cá biệt đã thu nhận được những điều vô cùng quý giá để lớn lên thành một con người hoàn thiện, mạnh mẽ.\nTotto-chan bên cửa sổ, là cuốn sách gối đầu giường của nhiều thế hệ trẻ em trên toàn thế giới suốt ba mươi năm nay. Sau khi xuất bản lần đầu vào năm 1981, cuốn sách đã gây được tiếng vang lớn không chỉ ở Nhật Bản mà còn trên toàn thế giới. Tính đến năm 2001, tổng số bản sách bán ra ở Nhật đã lên đến 9,3 triệu bản, trở thành một trong những cuốn sách bán chạy nhất trong lịch sử ngành xuất bản nước này. Cuốn sách đã được dịch ra 33 thứ tiếng khác nhau, như Anh, Pháp, Đức, Hàn Quốc, Trung Quốc…Khi bản tiếng Anh của Totto-chan được xuất bản tại Mỹ, tờ New York Times đã đăng liền hai bài giới thiệu trọn trang, một “vinh dự” hầu như không tác phẩm nào có được.\nKuroyanagi Tetsuko là nhà văn thiếu nhi, đồng thời là một diễn viên và người dẫn chương trình truyền hình rất nổi tiếng ở Nhật Bản.\nBà là người sáng lập ra quỹ Totto Foundation, được đặt tên dựa theo cô bé Totto-chan trong cuốn sách nổi tiếng nhất của bà. Quỹ Totto Foundation đào tạo các diễn viên điếc một cách chuyên nghiệp, nhằm hiện thực hoá ý tưởng mang hát kịch đến với những người điếc của Kuroyanagi.\nNăm 1984, , bà được bổ nhiệm làm Đại sứ Thiện chí của Quỹ Nhi đồng Liên hiệp quốc, và là người châu Á đầu tiên ở vị trí này. Trong những năm cuối thập kỉ 80 và thập kỉ 90, bà đã đến thăm rất nhiều quốc gia đang phát triển ở châu Á và châu Phi để làm từ thiện và thực hiện các nhiệm vụ thiện chí, giúp đỡ trẻ em đang phải chịu cảnh thiên tai và chiến tranh, đồng thời nâng cao sự chú ý của quốc tế đối với trẻ em ở những nước nghèo. Kuroyanagi quyên góp được hơn 20 triệu đô cho các chương trình của UNICEF mà bà có tham gia hoạt động qua các chiến dịch quyên góp trên truyền hình. Bà cũng ủng hộ tiền bản quyền của cuốn sách Totto-chan cho UNICEF.\nNăm 1997, Kuroyanagi xuất bản cuốn sách Những đứa trẻ của Totto-chan, dựa trên những trải nghiệm khi bà làm Đại sứ Thiện chí của UNICEF từ năm 1984 đến năm 1996.\nNgoài ra, Kuroyanagi còn là Giám đốc khu vực Nhật Bản của quỹ Bảo tồn Thiên nhiên Thế giới (WWF).\nVới những thành tựu trong lĩnh vực truyền thông và truyền hình, Kuroyanagi đã giành giải thưởng Japanese Cultural Broadcasting, được coi là niềm vinh dự cao nhất trong giới truyền hình Nhật Bản. Sau đó, bà đã được đề cử 14 lần cho danh hiệu nhân vật truyền hình được yêu thích nhất Nhật Bản.\nNăm 2000, Kuroyanagi là người đầu tiên nhận giải Global Leadership for Children được thành lập bởi UNICEF nhân kỉ niệm 10 năm ngày Hội nghị Thượng đỉnh Thế giới về Trẻ em năm 1990.\nTháng 5/2003, Kuroyanagi nhận Huân chương Thuỵ Bảo của Nhật Hoàng vì những cống hiến của bà cho trẻ em thế giới trong suốt hai thập kỉ.\nĐặc biệt: Với mỗi cuốn sách \"Totto-chan bên cửa sổ\" bán được sẽ trích ra 10.000 đồng để gửi tới các em nhỏ Nhật Bản là nạn nhân trực tiếp và gián tiếp của thảm họa thiên nhiên vừa qua.\n",

    "description": "Truyện cổ Triều Tiên là tập hợp những câu chuyện cổ tích, thần thoại, truyện ngụ ngôn loài vật và cả những truyện dân gian. Bạn đọc có thể tìm thấy chuyện về Ông Trời và các thần linh; chuyện về những thầy pháp đạo shaman; chuyện về tokkaebi, hay còn được gọi với cái tên “quỷ một chân” hay “linh hồn của bóng tối và hư vô”; và dĩ nhiên không thể thiếu những câu chuyện về hổ, gấu, rùa, và những loài vật thiêng liêng như rồng, phượng hoàng. Bên cạnh loạt truyện cổ tích mang màu sắc thần thoại và truyện ngụ ngôn loài vật, trong tập sách còn xuất hiện những truyện kể dân gian về cuộc sống của những người dân bình thường, thường là nông dân hoặc dân miền núi. Bối cảnh của truyện có thể là trong rừng, trong những thôn bản nhưng cũng có khi lại xảy ra tại những thị trấn lớn, nơi có giới quý tộc hay tầng lớp Lưỡng Ban - những người học hành đỗ đạt, làm quan lại triều đình.\nThông qua những câu chuyện đó, người xưa đã thể hiện suy nghĩ, tâm tư tình cảm của bản thân, sự quyến luyến, yêu thương giữa những người cùng huyết thống, hàng xóm láng giềng, đến mối quan hệ với thiên nhiên, đất nước cũng như thể hiện quan niệm về nhìn nhận lý giải thiên nhiên và thích nghi, đối phó với môi trường. Ngoài ra trong mỗi câu chuyện là một bài học ẩn chứa. Người xưa nhấn mạnh và đề cao lòng tốt, sự chân thành, quả cảm, lòng hiếu thảo, trí thông minh và sự hóm hỉnh của những thường dân, lên án thói kiêu căng và hám lợi hay những hành vi bất lương của những kẻ nắm trong tay quyền lực. Những kẻ bất lương, độc ác, thất đức sẽ bị trừng phạt. Còn những người tốt, thật thà, chăm chỉ sẽ được đền đáp xứng đáng.\nNgoài những nét tương đồng vốn đã tồn tại trong tín ngưỡng và đời sống của các nước châu Á, các câu chuyện trong Truyện cổ Triều Tiên vẫn còn đó những nét đặc sắc riêng cần khám phá. Tất cả làm nên một kho truyện cổ kỳ thú.\n",

    "description": "Cuốn sách là cuộc hành trình hương vị trên khắp 7 xứ sở nước Ý, một đất nước với nền ẩm thực đặc trưng lâu đời bậc nhất thế giới.\nTại Việt Nam, có một chàng “phù thuỷ trẻ” say mê ẩm thực Ý đã kì công đi, đọc, chụp, viết để cho ra đời những món ăn độc đáo, ấn tượng, cầu  kỳ, thể hiện tình yêu và sự am hiểu sâu sắc về nền ẩm thực quyến rũ bậc nhất trên Thế giới, đó là Lỗ Võ Bảo Lâm (LV. Lâm), chủ nhân Food Blog “A guy who cooks“. Trước khi bắt đầu ý tưởng xuất bản cuốn sách nấu ăn đầu tiên của mình, LV. Lâm đã rất quen thuộc trong giới yêu bếp với tư cách là một Food Blogger khá cao tay trong việc cảm nhận và viết lách. Các bài viết về đồ ăn Ý của LV. Lâm là những sự đầu tư cẩn thận và chất lượng cả về hình ảnh lẫn nội dung. Chàng trai tự nhận mình là “tên phát xít ẩm thực” này không bao giờ cho phép bản thân hay bất cứ ai, thể hiện một sự cẩu thả, hời hợt, qua loa khi đứng bếp, cũng như bất kỳ công việc mang tính chuyên môn nào. Bằng những trải nghiệm và cảm nhận tinh tế qua mỗi lần khám phá ẩm thực của nhiều vùng miền các nước châu Âu và đặc biệt là Ý, bằng niềm đam mê chân thành với những món ăn Âu mới lạ, bằng sự hoạt ngôn trong viết lách, tinh tế trong nhiếp ảnh, sáng tạo trong chế biến món ăn, có thể nói, mỗi sản phẩm “cộp mác” LV. Lâm đều là một thành phẩm biểu trưng cho sự sắc sảo. Và Lamissimo - Nắng thảo mộc chính là cuốn sách đầu tay với tất cả những đúc kết đầy tâm huyết của chàng trai trẻ tài năng và cầu toàn Lỗ Võ Bảo Lâm.\n\nLamissimo - Nắng thảo mộc không đơn thuần là một cuốn cookbook chỉ hướng dẫn chúng ta cách nấu một vài món ăn Ý lạ miệng. Cuốn sách là một mảnh hồn Ý, là sự thu nhỏ cả bầu trời Nam Âu, là không gian tím biếc của những giàn nho miệt vườn trải dài từ điểm đầu tới cuối đất nước hình chiếc ủng. Cuốn sách 236 trang với gần 30 công thức là hành trình học hỏi tìm tòi dài hơi của Lỗ Võ Bảo Lâm trong việc bảo tồn và cách tân những món ăn cổ truyền nước Ý. Tác giả cho rằng “Ăn cái hồn nước Ý có nghĩa là hưởng cái vị mằn mặn của Địa Trung Hải, cái hương thơm ngọt ngào của các loại thảo mộc và cái sự giàu có của dầu oliu, của rượu vang”. Chúng ta sẽ tìm thấy trong Lamissimo - Nắng thảo mộc những món Ý ngon và đẹp như thế. Những công thức đi từ đơn giản cho tới cầu kỳ trong cuốn sách đã thể hiện một thế giới ẩm thực hấp dẫn đầy màu sắc. Có những phương pháp đòi hỏi người thực hiện phải kiên nhẫn trong một tháng để thành phẩm đạt được sự hoàn hảo. Đó có thể nói là một phong cách nấu nướng “rất Lâm”. Cái ngon, cái đẹp, cái hoàn thiện, trước hết phải bắt nguồn từ cái tỉ mỉ.\nĐây sẽ là một cuốn cookbook chưa - từng - có và dự kiến trở thành ấn phẩm có tiềm năng “bùng nổ” nhất cuối hè này.\n\n",

Già thì khổ, ai cũng biết. Sanh lão bệnh tử. Nhưng già vẫn có thể sướng. Muốn sống lâu thì phải già chớ sao! Già có cái đẹp của già. Trái chín cây bao giờ cũng ngon hơn trái giú ép. Cái sướng đầu tiên của già là biết mình… già, thấy mình già, như trái chín cây thấy mình đang chín trên cây.\nBác sĩ đã “bắt bệnh” cho người già với ba nỗi khổ thường gặp:\n- Một là thiếu bạn. Nhìn qua nhìn lại, bạn cứ rơi rụng dần…\n- Hai là thiếu… ăn. Không phải vì không có điều kiện ăn mà người già thường thích những món ăn kỳ cục, và phải lắng nghe mệnh lệnh của bao tử…\n- Ba là thiếu vận động! Già thì hai chân trở nên nặng nề, như mọc dài ra, biểu không chịu nghe lời ta nữa!\nGiải quyết được ba cái bệnh trên thì có thể nói già mà sướng.\n",

Đó là phân đoạn ngọt ngào trong nhà bếp, nơi cô chia sẻ những kinh nghiệm tâm huyết và thú vị nhất về bánh ngọt và tráng miệng. Ngay sau khi cuốn sách đến tay độc giả, rất nhiều người đã hỏi Phan Anh và I loveCookbook rằng, vậy sau Ngọt sẽ là Mặn ư, hay đắng-cay-chua... nào? Được độc giả đón nhận, say mê làm theo những công thức trong sách và chia sẻ lại cảm nhận tích cực với tác giả qua những trao đổi trên mạng xã hội như Facebook, là niềm hạnh phúc lớn lao của tác giả. Nhưng đó cũng thật là một \"sức ép\", khi các bạn đều mong muốn và chờ đón có cuốn tiếp theo của sê-ri cookbook \"Mật Mã Yêu Thương\" từ Esheep.\n\nMột năm qua, là quãng thời gian Phan Anh miệt mài và bận rộn \"thai nghén\" cho ấn phẩm thứ hai này, miệt mài ghi lại những công thức, những món ăn ngon từ chính căn bếp gia đình mình, những muốn tiếp tục được chia sẻ nó với các bạn. Nhưng cô ấy thật bối rối vô cùng khi chọn đặt tên cho nó. Là Mặn ư, không hẳn. Cũng không phải là một cảm giác riêng lẻ nào hết của vị giác. Đối với Esheep, cuốn thứ hai này như một bản hợp xướng mùi vị, đủ đầy cả đắng-cay-mặn-ngọt. Đủ đầy tất cả mọi cung bậc của cảm xúc, đủ đầy tất cả mọi sắc thái của việc vào bếp. Và chỉ có thể gọi đó là YÊU. YÊU là cảm xúc chân thật nhất khi tác giả thực hiện cuốn sách thứ hai này. Cuốn sách ghi lại những công thức ngon lành từ bếp, dành cho những kẻ yêu nhau, dành cho người muốn vào bếp, làm ra những món ăn ngon lành cho người mình yêu. Vì vậy, các công thức được chia sẻ trong cuốn sách thứ hai này hầu hết đều đơn giản, dễ làm, sáng tạo và nhiều sắc thái như chính tình yêu vậy. Nó cũng hoàn toàn ngẫu hứng như khi bạn yêu...\n\nBạn có thể nhẩn nha đọc nó và YÊU, lật giở bất cứ trang nào ra cũng có thể tìm thấy một công thức để nấu cho người mình yêu, dù là một bữa sáng, một món bánh ngọt hay tráng miệng, một tiệc hai-người lãng mạn, hay bữa tối sau ngày dài làm việc mệt mỏi. Các công thức trong cuốn này hầu hết đều là thực đơn vừa vặn dành cho hai người. Nhưng có hề gì, bạn có thể nhân đôi nó lên để nấu một bữa đủ cho gia đình. Cuốn sách được lấy cảm hứng từ YÊU và ĐI. Vì vậy nó đầy ngẫu hứng và trải nghiệm cá nhân thú vị của tác giả. Có thể là bữa sáng với salad kiểu Ý, hay một bữa trưa cuối tuần với món mì trứng tươi truyền thống kiểu Đức... không cứng nhắc, không nguyên tắc nào cần cho cuốn sách này.\n\nBên cạnh đó, \"phù thủy\" Phan Anh còn chia sẻ những kinh nghiệm làm bếp của chính mình trong chương sách mang tên \"Bùa bếp\". Cuốn cookbook \"Vị yêu\" mong muốn đem lại cho bạn cái nhìn tươi trẻ, đa sắc thái về ẩm thực, kéo bạn gần hơn với đam mê vào bếp, gần hơn với thói quen mày mò tìm hiểu và trải nghiệm một thế giới ẩm thực phong phú, đáng lưu giữ và chia sẻ.\nVà cũng như YÊU thôi, hãy giữ tâm hồn bạn giản dị nhất, ngọt ngào và hiền dịu nhất khi vào bếp!\n",

Đái tháo đường có thể xuất hiện khi tụy không tiết đủ insulin, hoặc nếu các tế bào của cơ thể trở nên kháng sinh insulin; vì thế, đường máu không thể đi vào trong tế bào, dẫn tới các biến chứng nghiêm trọng.\nCác triệu trứng cổ điển của đái tháo đường là đi tiểu thường xuyên, và khát cùng đói nhiều. Do những triệu chứng này không nặng, nên nhiều người bị đái tháo đường không tới các cơ sở y tế. Thực tế, trong số 10 triệu người Mỹ bị đái tháo đường, thì chỉ dưới một nữa biết rằng mình bị bệnh hay đã từng tới bác sĩ.

    "description": "Finger Food at Nineteen 11 - Miếng nhỏ đậm đà là những “miếng cắn cỡ nhỏ đầy hương vị” trong cuộc du hành đầy màu sắc mà bếp trưởng Dương Hải Anh muốn gửi tới các bạn độc giả. Thấu hiểu tâm lý của những bà nội trợ, Chef Hải Anh biết rằng thế giới ẩm thực nhà hàng vô cùng hấp dẫn, thú vị, nhưng quy mô của nó lại lớn hơn nhiều so với quy mô giới hạn của những căn bếp gia đình.\nThật không dễ cho chúng ta trong việc thực hiện những “món ăn kiểu nhà hàng” tại nhà mình bởi các yêu cầu khắt khe về không gian, nguyên liệu, dụng cụ, hay quy trình chế biến của nó. Giản lược đi các công đoạn chế biến, đơn giản hóa các nguyên liệu phức tạp, chú trọng vào việc gìn giữ trọn vẹn hương vị và màu sắc món ăn, Chef Hải Anh đã tạo ra những “miếng ngon trên đầu đũa” thỏa mãn chúng ta cả về thị giác lẫn vị giác qua ấn phẩm cookbook Miếng nhỏ đậm đà. Đặc biệt, với thời gian thực hiện các món ăn chỉ từ 10 -15 phút, bạn có thể tự tin biến căn bếp của mình trở thành địa điểm tụ họp bạn bè ấm cúng, hay một không gian cho bữa tối 2 người, thậm chí hoàn toàn có thế tự tin bài trí thành những bữa tiệc gặp gỡ sang trọng.\n\nMiếng nhỏ đậm đà ra đời như một cuốn cẩm nang ẩm thực hữu hiệu giúp hiện thực hóa ước mơ của những bà nội trợ. Nhỏ xinh từ tên gọi cho đến hình dáng nhưng cuốn sách của Chef Hải Anh lại mang trong mình sứ mệnh lớn lao: Đưa ẩm thực nhà hàng đến gần hơn với mỗi gia đình nhỏ. Bạn sẽ không nhất thiết phải chi những tờ hóa đơn đắt đỏ mà vẫn có thể thưởng thức những món ăn ngon lành, độc đáo; đặc biệt hơn, những đĩa thức ăn tuyệt đẹp trên mặt bàn kia được đưa ra từ chính Bếp-của-bạn.\nBằng tinh thần cầu thị và không ngừng khám phá, Miếng nhỏ đậm đà còn được coi như cuốn “cẩm nang nghề bếp” của chef Hải Anh, ghi lại quá trình đi nhiều nơi, tiếp cận nhiều nền văn hóa cũng như ẩm thực khác nhau, đồng thời là hành trình khẳng định vai trò của chị trong tư thế một nữ bếp trưởng đầy tài năng và mạnh mẽ.\n\nNhận định\n\"Tôi coi những người như chị Hải Anh là một thế hệ đầu bếp thời hiện đại, những người không chịu giam bản thân mình chỉ trong căn bếp rồi lãnh đạm với những phần còn lại của cuộc sống.Thật sự mà nói, một đầu bếp giỏi, từ một bà nội trợ cho đến một “chiến binh”đầu bếp trong nhà hàng 5 sao luôn cần có một trải nghiệm tuyệt vời về cuộc sống.\n(...) Tôi nghĩ những người phụ nữ thời hiện đại nên học tập một phần của chị Hải Anh. Phụ nữ tự đặt bản thân mình vào hoàn cảnh lệ thuộc vào gia đình hoặc chồng bởi họ không độc lập. Nếu bạn không có gia đình để dựa vào, cũng không có ai nâng đỡ, tất cả những gì bạn có thể chọn làm điểm tựa chỉ có ý chí và năng lực của bản thân.\"\n(Lu - Mann up)\n",

Ví dụ như ăn nhiều đường sẽ bệnh đái tháo đường? Thật ra, ăn nhiều đường không phải là nguyên nhân trực tiếp khiến bạn mắc bệnh, mà sử dụng nhiều đường sẽ khiến bạn dễ tăng cân, mà thừa cân có thể làm tăng nguy cơ bị đái tháo đường tuýp 2.

Được đặt hết trước 2.000 bản sách chỉ trong vài giờ đồng hồ ngay từ khi chưa ấn hành, với số lượng phát hành trong chưa đầy năm đã lên tới hơn 2 vạn bản, Nhật ký học làm bánh đã trở thành hiện tượng của mảng sách cookbook trong năm 2014, là cuốn sách gối đầu giường của nhiều người yêu thích nghệ thuật làm bánh ngọt.\n\nSau hơn một năm chuẩn bị kỹ lưỡng, Nhật ký học làm bánh 2 tập trung vào nhiều loại bánh quen thuộc nhưng không dễ chinh phục - chẳng hạn như các loại bánh mì - và được đầu tư công phu về mặt trình bày hứa hẹn sẽ còn mang đến nhiều điều thú vị hơn nữa cho người đọc. Hi vọng cuốn sách có thể giúp bạn tiến bước thuận lợi, suôn sẻ trên hành trình \"bơ-bột- trứng\", làm sao tránh được nhiều nhất các “ổ voi” thất bại khiến cho bánh từ lò nướng bay thẳng tới thùng rác. Và cũng mong rằng, những ghi chép từ quá trình tự học làm bánh của tác giả sẽ tăng thêm quyết tâm, gạt bỏ đôi chút chần chừ, lưỡng lự của những bạn trẻ muốn “dấn thân” vào con đường này.\n\n“Tất cả chúng ta, ai cũng có thể trở thành vua bánh trong căn bếp của gia đình!\"\n",

Đặc điểm độc đáo của tập sách này là sắp xếp các món ngon theo từng họ tộc.

Vẫn với tinh thần “mookbook = mood + cookbook” của series Những Ngón Tay Vani, Ngày Vàng Hạnh Phúc sẽ là bức tranh ẩm thực và văn hóa sinh động nhất được vẽ lên bằng nguồn cảm hứng bất tận từ cuộc sống, thiên nhiên, cảnh quan và con người xung quanh tác giả Yun Lukas.\nCuốn sách sẽ là một cuộc hành trình đưa bạn chu du từ Thủ Đô cổ kính tới cực Bắc cheo leo đầy nông sản tươi ngọt, từ Sài Gòn hoa lệ lấp lánh tới Đà Lạt mù sương với những thức uống ấm nồng. Rồi cả mùa Thu của nước Nhật - mang trong mình sẵn đầy chất huyền ảo thơ mộng hay mùa Đông của nước Úc giá lạnh mà đắm say. Không chỉ là những công thức “cá tính và mới mẻ” đậm chất Yun Lukas, Ngày Vàng Hạnh Phúc thực sự sẽ là một cuốn nhật ký cảm hứng có thể theo bạn trong mọi cuộc du ngoạn của cuộc đời - để cảm thấy sẵn lòng đón nhận hơn, khát khao khám phá hơn và yêu thương cuộc sống muôn màu hơn.\nBốn mùa trong năm ngoài việc mang tới những cảm xúc, kỷ niệm khác nhau, cũng mang đến những món sản vật tuyệt tác khác nhau mà thiên nhiên ban tặng, 34 công thức bánh ngọt và món ăn trong Ngày Vàng Hạnh Phúc lấy cảm hứng từ chủ đề “Mùa vàng” sẽ luôn khiến gian bếp nhỏ nhà bạn tràn đầy sức sống cùng những bữa ăn đủ đầy hương vị và ấm nồng tình yêu. Đặc biệt, là một người đặc biệt yêu thích Giáng Sinh, Greeting Season của Ngày Vàng Hạnh Phúc giống như một thước phim quay chậm từ những ngày bắt đầu tháng 12 man mác, khi thành phố bắt đầu chuyển mình và những thân cây xám xịt bên phố cũng được trang hoàng thêm những dây đèn rực rỡ, đến những buổi giữa mùa từng khung cửa sổ mỗi gia đình bắt đầu lấp lánh thứ ánh sáng từ những quả châu xanh - đỏ và tới sát ngày Chúa giáng sinh thì những hộp quà xinh xắn, những bông tuyết long lanh, những viên truffles hương rượu Rum nồng nàn hay món Yule Log truyền thống sẽ làm bữa tiệc của đêm thực sự đúng điệu, an lành và hạnh phúc hệt như cái cách chúng ta luôn mong đợi.\nVậy, bạn đã sẵn sàng mang Giáng Sinh về nhà chưa?\n",

Ông là hình mẫu thành đạt mà nhiều người trong xã hội hướng tới. Nhưng trong những con người mẫu mực dường như luôn ẩn chứa những bế tắc. Chuyện ngoại tình của nhà phê bình là tâm điểm của tiểu thuyết Tiếng cười trong bóng tối. Bruno trở thành nạn nhân của những đam mê bị kìm nén do chính mình tạo ra. Để rồi, ông rơi vào bẫy của cặp tình nhân trẻ tuổi. Họ biến ông thành diễn viên chính trong vở hài kịch mà họ vừa là đạo diễn vừa là khán giả. Cuộc đời Bruno kết thúc trong thảm họa đúng như tác giả đã báo trước ngay đầu tác phẩm.\nNgoại tình vốn là câu chuyện đầy rẫy trong đời thường, và là đề tài quen thuộc trong văn chương. Nhưng Tiếng cười trong bóng tối đã kể một câu chuyện ngoại tình với tất cả chiều sâu nội tâm phức tạp, đầy màu sắc trong diễn biến được xem là phổ biến đến tẻ nhạt. Bằng cách sử dụng ngôn ngữ bậc thầy, tác giả đẩy giác quan người đọc đến cấp độ nhạy cảm nhất, đưa tới một trải nghiệm về nỗi thống khổ hài hước của con người.\nNếu như Lolita được tác giả Vladimir Nabokov dịch từ tiếng Anh sang tiếng Nga, thì Tiếng cười trong bóng tối lại được dịch từ tiếng Nga sang tiếng Anh. Trong quá trình chuyển ngữ, tác giả Nabokov đã nảy sinh ra nhiều tình tiết mới cho tác phẩm, và ông đã viết lại thành một Tiếng cười trong bóng tối hoàn toàn mới bằng tiếng Anh.\n(Theo Lam Thu)\n",

    "description": "Khi Cuộc thi Vua đầu bếp - MasterChef Vietnam mùa 1 kết thúc,  ngoài chiến thắng thuyết phục của Vua đầu bếpNgô Thanh Hòa, người hâm mộ ẩm thực Việt Nam chắc chắn không thể không ấn tượng với cô Việt kiều với chiếc làn cói và nụ cười thân thiện rạng rỡ Phan Thắng Thái Hòa. Người ta nhắc đến Thái Hòa nhiều về sự sáng tạo đầy ngẫu hứng trong cách sử dụng nguyên liệu, luôn tạo ra những món ăn thành phẩm gây bất ngờ thú vị, và cũng yêu thích cô ấy bởi sự dí dỏm thông minh trong cách ứng xử và đặc biệt là đặt tên cho những món ăn của mình, như Gà bí mật, Cá sa mạc hay Thịt kho ký ức…\nTrở về từ cuộc thi, Thái Hòa say sưa với ý tưởng cho ra đời cuốn Cookbook đầu tiên của mình, và như thế Ngẫu hứng vào bếp ra đời - như một cuốn nhật ký đam mê và chia sẻ những kinh nghiệm quý báu cũng như những bài học ẩm thực đã đưa cô ấy đến thành công tại MasterChef.\nNgẫu hứng vào bếp là cuốn sách món mặn đầu tiên do I love Cookbook xuất bản với 41 công thức nấu ăn từ đơn giản đến phức tạp, bao gồm từ những món ăn dân dã đời thường nhất nhưng được biến tấu trong cách xử lý nguyên liệu và kỹ thuật nấu, mang lại hương vị độc đáo như Thịt kho ký ức, Tép rang xoài hay Cá bống kho…cho tới những món ăn đóng mác Phan Thắng Thái Hòa tại cuộc thi MasterChef như Chuột Ratatouille, Gà bí mật hay Cua sốt Yoghurt. Cuốn sách đặc biệt có những món ăn mà Thái Hòa tâm đắc như  “Tía, Má, Con Mực” - món khai vị chị rất thích vì cái tên rất dân gian gần gũi, vị đậm đà; kế đến là món “Bò Vĩ Đại”- món súp thanh tao, nhẹ nhàng nhưng no lâu vì nhiều protein khi ăn thêm với bánh mì và tráng miệng với món kem “Ngũ quả”.\nChia sẻ về cuốn sách đầu tay của mình, Thái Hòa cho biết: \"Ý tưởng về cuốn sách được hình thành rất nhanh khi tôi được mời xuất bản, vì tôi nghĩ đó là mối quan tâm của chính bản thân tôi khi tôi bước vào bếp. Cuốn sách của tôi mang tên “NGẪU HỨNG VÀO BẾP”, theo tôi nấu ăn bình thường là một nhu cầu căn bản, tuy nhiên đôi lúc cảm giác “phải nấu” đánh tan đi cảm hứng để tạo ra một món ăn ngon, đẹp và lạ (là mục tiêu kế tiếp). Trong cuốn sách này, tôi muốn đem lại 1 kiểu nấu ăn ngẫu nhiên tùy hứng dựa trên các nguyên liệu có sẵn hoặc bắt gặp ngoài chợ. Các món ăn không quá cầu kỳ phức tạp về kỹ thuật nấu nướng để các bạn có thể ứng dụng nhanh. Và cũng có món cần lâu, khi bạn thật sự muốn nấu một bữa thật hoành tráng, tất cả đều rất ngẫu hứng.\"\nBởi vậy, thực hiện cuốn sách này, với một số món ăn tuy ngẫu hứng nhưng ngon miệng, Thái Hòa và I love Cookbook hy vọng sẽ truyền được cảm hứng cho độc giả trong cách nấu, từ đơn giản đến nhiều công đoạn, với các nguyên liệu có sẵn ở nhà hay mới gặp ngoài chợ, sao cho món ăn luôn mới mẻ phong phú, không nhất thiết phải theo khuôn phép có sẵn.\n",

    "description": "Trả lời câu hỏi của nhiều người thắc mắc vì sao lại viết cuốn sách Dạy trẻ kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của cái đầu gối bị trầy xước, tác giả trả lời:\n“Tôi viết sách để nhắc nhở bản thân mình làm theo những gì được viết trong đó. Và điều này gần như luôn có tác dụng. Bằng cách sử dụng những bài học của đạo Do Thái do chính mình nhắc đến trong cuốn sách, tôi đã không còn bao bọc thái quá, luôn lên sẵn lịch trình, nuông chiều và đặt những kỳ vọng cao ngút trời vào con cái  những thứ vốn là chuẩn mực của vùng Los Angeles, nơi tôi nuôi dạy hai cô con gái nhỏ của mình. Tôi rất rõ ràng và có chiến lược trong việc dạy bọn trẻ biết kính trọng cha mẹ, tôi cũng cố gắng tôn trọng các con bằng cách trân trọng cả tài năng lẫn khuyết điểm của chúng. Ngày nào tôi cũng nhắc bản thân mình nhớ đến câu nói trong đạo Do Thái rằng mọi bậc cha mẹ đều phải dạy con mình học bơi - tôi đã áp dụng triết lý này bằng cách để các con gái mình leo lên những thân cây thật cao, dùng những con dao sắc nhọn, nấu ăn với chiếc chảo nóng và tất nhiên, vì tôi sống ở Nam California, dạy chúng bơi, nhảy từ trên cao và lặn xuống những vùng nước sâu ngay từ khi chúng còn rất nhỏ.\nKhi tôi phát hành cuốn sách đầu tiên, các con tôi mới 9 và 13 tuổi. Tôi đã hoàn toàn tự tin khi nghĩ đến quãng thời gian chúng bắt đầu trưởng thành. Khi các con gái tôi bước vào tuổi mới lớn, tôi đã là một chuyên gia. Thật thế. Tôi là một nhà tâm lý học xã hội, có nghĩa rằng tôi được đào tạo bài bản để nhìn nhận các vấn đề liên quan đến cảm xúc trong từng bối cảnh văn hóa cụ thể. Chuyên ngành của tôi là nuôi dạy con cái và sự phát triển bình thường của trẻ. Tôi đã làm việc với các gia đình trong suốt 30 năm liền. Tôi hiểu về các học thuyết liên quan đến vấn đề cá tính hóa, tác động của tuổi dậy thì đến tính cách, nhịp điệu sinh lý hàng ngày phá vỡ giấc ngủ như thế nào và khao khát phiêu lưu mạo hiểm ở tuổi mới lớn.\nTôi cũng ý thức rất rõ về tác động của nền văn hóa vận động nhanh chóng, đầy cạnh tranh, thô bạo cùng sự phát triển của công nghệ Internet đến việc phát triển một nhân cách tốt ở giới trẻ. Tôi đồng thời rất chú ý đến việc trẻ mới lớn rất dễ bị tổn thương bởi sự lo lắng, thói quen ăn uống bừa bãi, tình trạng tự làm bản thân bị thương, sự thất vọng, các vấn đề liên quan đến học tập, sự chú ý cũng như việc lạm dụng thuốc. Tôi hình dung rằng với hàng tá những bí quyết liên quan đến chuyên môn cũng như tôn giáo, tôi sẽ dẫn các con gái mình vượt qua tất cả những mối nguy hiểm thường thấy của tuổi mới lớn. Và khi bước qua ngưỡng tuổi đó, các con gái tôi sẽ trở thành những con người có trách nhiệm, trưởng thành và là những thành viên gia đình tốt hơn. Dưới sự hướng dẫn chín chắn của tôi, chúng tôi sẽ có những mối quan tâm chung và những cuộc trò chuyện sâu sắc hơn. Vòng quay cuộc sống thường nhật của gia đình tôi cũng sẽ trơn tru hơn khi giờ đây các thành viên trong gia đình đã cao lớn, thông minh, ăn rơ với nhau và sáng tạo hơn.\"\nXin giới thiệu với bạn đọc những lời khen tặng dành cho cuốn sách Dạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ.\n“Giọng văn đầy cảm thông của Mogel trong cuốn sách hữu ích này có thể sẽ là cứu cánh cho các vị phụ huynh.”- Nhật báo Người Do Thái“Đây là cuốn sách gối đầu giường cho tất cả các bậc phụ huynh, dù họ theo tôn giáo nào… Dạy trẻ kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ cho độc giả thấy họ đang có rất nhiều điều may mắn. Mogel đã cố gói ghém rất nhiều lời khuyên thông thái trong khuôn khổ một cuốn sách.”- Nhật báo Người Do Thái ở San Diego\n“Cuốn sách đầy những nội dung sâu sắc về việc làm sao để nuôi dạy nên được những thanh thiếu niên niên kiên cường. Mogel đã đưa ra rất nhiều những kiến thức hợp tình hợp lý. Bạn sẽ cảm thấy được an ủi và nhắc nhở rằng dù những năm tháng khi bọn trẻ đến tuổi vị thành niên rất khó khăn nhưng rồi con bạn sẽ trở thành những người lớn tự tin và hạnh phúc.”- Tạp chí Phụ nữ Do Thái\n“Cuốn sách hay nhất về chủ đề nuôi dạy trẻ vị thành niên.”- Điểm sách Rosebud\nMục lục\nChương 1: Sự may mắn ẩn giấu trong việc nuôi dạy con cái ở độ tuổi mới lớn\nChương 2: Sự may mắn khi có những đứa con kỳ quặc: Chấp nhận vẻ đẹp độc đáo của bọn trẻ\nChương 3: Sự may mắn của thái độ khó chịu: Khoan dung với sự hỗn láo thường xuyên của bọn trẻ\nChương 4: Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ : Bài học thực sự từ Bài tập về nhà, Việc nhà và Việc làm\nChương 5: Sự may mắn của chiếc áo len bị mất tích: Kiềm chế chủ nghĩa vật chất, quyền hành và sự vô ý thức của trẻ mới lớn\nChương 6: Sự may mắn của những vấn đề phải giải quyết : Để bọn trẻ học hỏi từ những đánh giá sai lầm và tình huống căng thẳng\nChương 7: Sự may mắn của việc thức khuya : Dành thời gian để nghỉ ngơi và thư giãn\nChương 8: Sự may mắn của việc phá luật: Cuộc sống thực giống như phòng thí nghiệm đạo đức\nChương 9: Sự may mắn của cơn say: Cách tiếp cận mộ đạo đối với vấn đề tình dục và chất kích thích\nChương 10: Dũng khí để con đi“Mẹ à, con đi bơi được không?\nĐược, con gái yêu quý của ta\nHãy treo quần áo của con lên cành gỗ mại châu\nNhưng đừng đến gần mặt nước.”\n(Mother Goose)\n",

    "description": "Nhà tâm lý học điều trị, diễn giả, nhà tư vấn thông thái được cả thế giới ca ngợi - TS. Wendy Mogel đã đánh trúng tình cảm của hàng ngàn độc giả và trở thành một trong những tác giả viết sách cha mẹ đáng tin cậy nhất. Mogel nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của việc cha mẹ nên đồng cảm và hướng dẫn thay vì quản lý từ những việc nhỏ nhất trong cuộc sống và có phản ứng thái quá với những sai lầm của bọn trẻ. Bà tiết lộ rằng sự bùng nổ cảm xúc, hỗn láo, phá vỡ quy tắc, thức khuya và các hành vi đáng lo ngại khác của bọn trẻ thực ra là hoàn toàn bình thường và là những bước cần thiết trong sự phát triển tâm lý cũng như nhân cách của chúng. Chúng ta không nên quá lo lắng mà hãy thật sự quan tâm đến bọn trẻ. Với sự hóm hỉnh và ấm áp tuyệt vời, Mogel đã cung cấp cho các bậc cha mẹ công cụ để làm được điều đó, bà đưa ra lời khuyên về các vấn đề:\n- Tại sao gây ảnh hưởng lại hiệu quả hơn kiểm soát\n- Chủ nghĩa vị kỷ của trẻ mới lớn\n- Khoan dung với sự hỗn láo của bọn trẻ\n- Giá trị đáng ngạc nhiên của những công việc thường ngày\n- Tại sao sự liều lĩnh lại là bước chuẩn bị cần thiết cho những năm học trung học\n- Khi nào nên can thiệp và khi nào nên lùi lại?\n“Cuốn sách của Wendy Mogel khiến độc giả cảm thấy an tâm. Đây quả thực là một phước lành.”- Lisa Belkin, The New York Times\n“Đây chính là giọng nói mà mỗi bậc phụ huynh đều mong ước tìm thấy khi ngụp lặn trong sự bối rối của việc nuôi dạy con ngày nay: kiên nhẫn, hiểu biết, cảm thông và được đưa ra từ cả kiến thức nghề nghiệp lẫn trải nghiệm cá nhân.”- Judith Warner, tác giả các cuốn sách Sự điên rồ hoàn hảo (Perfect Madness) và Chúng ta có vấn đề (We’ve got issues) Mục lục\nCHƯƠNG I: Tôi đánh mất niềm tin và tìm được niềm tin mới\nCHƯƠNG 2: Hãy biết chấp nhận\nCon đặc biệt và cũng bình thường như bao bạn bè\nCHƯƠNG 3: Kính trọng cha mẹ\nCHƯƠNG 4: Tại sao Thiên Chúa không muốn bạn bảo vệ con quá mức\nCHƯƠNG 5: Dạy con biết ơn\nCHƯƠNG 6: Tìm thấy tia lửa linh thiêng trong những việc vặt hàng ngày\nChương 7: Áp dụng các nguyên lý về sự điều độ, tán dương và sự thánh hóa vào bàn ăn\nCHƯƠNG 8: Sự tự chủ\nĐiều chỉnh yetzer hara của con\nCHƯƠNG 9: Thời gian là vàng\nDạy con trân trọng giá trị của khoảnh khắc hiện tại\nCHƯƠNG 10: Niềm tin và truyền thống\nTừ bỏ nỗi sợ hãi đối với từ “Chúa” và dẫn dắt con đến với thế giới tâm linh\n",

    "description": "Hungazit Nguyen là một cái tên không còn xa lạ trong giới bếp chuyên nghiệp tại Hà Nội nói riêng và cộng đồng đầu bếp Việt Nam nói chung. Với gần 10 năm kinh nghiệm làm bếp tại các nhà hàng, khách sạn lớn, liên tục là giảng viên tại các trung tâm dạy nấu ăn nổi tiếng tại Hà Nội và thường xuyên tham gia các tour ẩm thực đường phố trong vai trò một hướng dẫn viên, kiến thức ẩm thực, sự gắn bó và niềm đam mê sâu sắc với ẩm thực dân tộc ngày lại một lớn dần trong trái tim của người đầu bếp trẻ.\nTrái tim của Chef không đơn thuần là cuốn cookbook đầu tay ghi lại chặng đường của anh từ một cậu bé ngây thơ sống trong cảnh bao cấp cực khổ đến một đầu bếp 5 sao hàng đầu Việt Nam, mà còn chứa đựng cả linh hồn Hà Nội, cả một ký ức nồng nàn ấm áp của ẩm thực cổ truyền đặc sắc, những tuyệt kỹ và tay nghề đỉnh cao của xu hướng ẩm thực hiện đại, và trên hết, là khát khao mong muốn hướng cái nhìn về nghề Bếp và các Đầu bếp, những người nấu ăn theo chiều hướng tích cực hơn và quyến rũ hơn được thể hiện qua những công thức, những shoot hình giản dị mà tinh tế và những cảm nhận dí dỏm nhưng vô cùng sâu sắc.\nCuốn sách gồm 60 công thức nấu ăn cả hiện đại cả cổ truyền, nhưng tất cả được sáng tạo trên nền tảng những nguyên liệu và hương vị đặc trưng của quê hương, như một cỗ máy du hành thời gian đưa bạn đi từ quá khứ tới hiện tại qua hành trình ẩm thực. Những người con sinh ra từ năm 80 trở về trước sẽ không khỏi bùi ngùi khi nhớ lại tuổi thơ bao cấp khốn khó của mình với món Canh dưa chua nấu tóp mỡ hoặc Tiết lợn xào giá đỗ đậu phụ.\n\nTuổi trẻ của những thanh niên Hà Nội hẳn ai cũng trải từng một lần trong đời trốn nhà đi ngắm phố phường đêm, hoà mình vào cái không khí tấp nập của Chợ đêm Long Biên hoặc lang thang cùng bạn bè ăn những món ăn đặc sản của Hà Nội như Chả rươi Ô Quan Chưởng, Bún ốc ngõ chợ và không thể bỏ qua được món Bún chả Hà Nội. Thêm nữa, nếu bạn yêu ẩm thực Việt Nam, đã từng được đi qua những vùng miền xa xôi và trải nghiệm biết bao món ăn đặc sản không thể nào thay thế, cuốn sách này sẽ mách bạn, bí quyết của những công thức gần gũi nhưng diệu kỳ, để có thể mang cả Việt Nam vào căn bếp nhỏ.\n \n\nTrái tim của Chef còn là một hình ảnh mới mẻ và đầy thú vị khác của Hungazit - một đầu bếp với kỹ năng và chuyên môn tuyệt vời nhưng ẩn chứa một tâm hồn tinh tế nhạy cảm, tuy mộc mạc nhưng cũng rất bay bổng, tình tứ. Bạn hẳn sẽ ngạc nhiên lắm khi bên trong người đàn ông có vẻ ngoài vạm vỡ, rắn chắc và có phần chai sạn ấy lại là những cảm nhận chân thực nhưng lãng mạn lý thú đến vậy. Cuốn sách sẽ mở ra cho bạn xem cách Hungazit kết hợp nhuần nhuyễn hai hương vị mộc mạc và tinh tế trong các công thức cuộc đời của mình thế nào!\n",

Thực chất Kindaichi là một người có cá tính mạnh mẽ, rất thông minh (có chỉ số IQ là 180) cùng với những suy luận sắc bén vì cậu ta là người có một dòng máu \"thiên tài\" từ ông nội của mình là một nhà thám tử nổi tiếng đại tài Hajime.\nKindaichi có một cô bạn gái thân với nhau từ nhỏ là Nanase Miyuki, một cô gái dễ thương có tính tình đáng yêu và được rất nhiều cậu con trai đào hoa phong nhả để ý nhưng cô chỉ luôn đi theo Kindaichi dù cậu ta là một người quậy phá, vô tích sự. Kindaichi cùng với cô bạn thân Miyuki luôn phiêu lưu vào những vụ án ghê rợn, đẫm máu và đầy bí ẩn thử thách của những kẻ giết người tàn ác. Hai viên cảnh sát thường có mặt trong truyện luôn được Kindaichi hỗ trợ phá án qua những vụ án mạng là Kenmochi Isamu và Akechi Kengo.\nNhững tập truyện Kindaichi lôi cuốn người đọc với những vụ giết người huyền bí và những màn phá án tuyệt vời của một cậu học sinh trung học. Những vụ án trong truyện thường là những vụ giết người trong phòng kín hay trên đảo hoang với những manh mối đặc sắc kèm theo những lời bí ẩn để lại tại hiện trường và hung thủ là những người quen thuộc đồng hành từ đầu tập.\nĐiều đáng chú ý ở Thám tử Kindaichi là kẻ giết người không bị tâm thần và những vụ giết người không vì lợi ích cá nhân. Những hung thủ bị vạch trần thường là do tổn thương nặng về tâm lí hoặc tình cảm vì nạn nhân gây ra cho mình trong quá khứ và có khi bắt nguồn từ lòng hận thù, ghen ghét đố kị, tham lam mù quáng, thói chuộng hư danh, ham muốn tiền tài vật chất... Nói chung tính chất tội phạm là do bắt nguồn từ ý muốn tham vọng cá nhân, thỏa mạn dục vọng thấp hèn của con người.\nNgoài những vụ án li kì hấp dẫn hồi hộp qua những pha phá án sắc sảo, những tập truyện Thám tử Kindaichi còn giáo dục cho thanh niên sống ngày nay phải bằng chính năng lực của mình, sống đúng với pháp luật, tội ác luôn bị trừng trị và cộng lí công bằng trong xã hội.\nTập 6\nĐược anh học của Miyuki nhờ vả, Kindaichi và Miyuki đã tham gia một tour du lịch thử nghiệm đến một resort cao cấp ở gần hồ Hiren.\nTrong lúc mọi người đang hào hứng thưởng thức bữa tiệc ngoài trời thì bỗng đâu một đài phát thanh đưa tin có một tên tử tội vượt ngục đang lảng vảng khu vực gần đó, khiến cảm giác bất an bao trùm lên mọi người.\nVà ngay sang hôm sau, một thành viên trong đoàn đã bị sát hại thảm khốc, khuôn mặt của nạn nhân bị rạch nát, y hệt như cách mà tên tử tội Jason đã từng ra tay với các nạn nhân trước kia của hắn!\n",

Nhân vật hoạt hình này đã nhận được sự yêu thích của nhiều khán giả nhỏ tuổi bởi sự nhí nhảnh, hồn nhiên “ điên rồ”  và ngoại hình kì quái mặc dù trong phim, chúng được các đạo diễn sắp đặt tính cách rất hậu đậu và chỉ làm việc với kẻ ác. Cơn sốt Minion chưa bao giờ lại bùng nổ như hiện nay. Sưu tầm cho mình những món đồ Minion là sở thích của nhiều em nhỏ và các bạn trẻ trong năm nay.\nHưởng ứng trào lưu này, cuốn truyện tranh Minions (Tập 1) - Banana! ra đời với những hình ảnh vô cùng đáng yêu kể về câu chuyện Minion đi xin việc làm, Minion chơi thể thao, Minion đi du lịch, Minion đi xe đạp điện, Minion giám sát sản xuất,...\n",

Xếp ba lô, nhảy lên xe đi khám phá những vùng đất xa xôi, trầm mình lắng nghe tổ quốc “bốn bề lên tiếng hát” trên những cung đường đất mẹ đã trở thành một thứ gia vị đậm đà trong cuộc sống của không ít bạn trẻ. Không phụ thuộc vào công ty du lịch, bạn có thể bất thần dừng chân giữa đường nếu muốn. Để ngả lưng một chút, hay để lưu lại những khoảnh khắc đẹp miên man trên đường. Đi du lịch bụi cho bạn cảm giác tự do mãnh liệt, những cảm nhận thật và gần gũi hơn với đất và người. Bạn được hoà mình trọn vẹn vào cảnh quan xung quanh, để cho mùi mưa, nắng, gió ngấm cả vào hồn. Đó là chất men của loại hình du lịch này vậy.\nKhác với du lịch theo tour, khi đi “phượt”, bạn phải tự mình tìm hiểu tuyến đường, lên lịch trình cho phù hợp, tự tìm thông tin về những địa điểm đáng lưu tâm và tự chuẩn bị nơi ăn chốn ở,… Vì bạn sẽ đi bằng phương tiện của mình, nên việc chuẩn bị lại càng phải chu đáo. Đi phượt không bao giờ dễ dàng, bạn sẽ phải đối mặt với đủ loại tình huống: đường quá xấu, xe hỏng, xăm thủng, lạc đường, kiệt sức,… Đây là những điều khó và cũng chính là một nét hấp dẫn khó cưỡng lại nổi với những kẻ trót say cảm giác phiêu lưu. Nó thử thách những giới hạn của bạn, nó làm bộc lộ trong bạn những con người mà trong hoàn cảnh bình thường bạn chẳng bao giờ biết đến. Vậy nên, đi “phượt” là để khám phá những vùng đất mới, và cũng là để khám phá chính mình.\n\n \nỞ Việt Nam, ai nghĩ đến chuyện đi “phượt” cũng ấp ủ khát khao chinh phục đủ bốn cực của hình chữ S cùng một đỉnh núi đã đi vào huyền thoại của các “phượt thủ”. Nếu bạn cũng tò mò về “phượt” và muốn tìm hiểu thêm về những chuyến đi như thế, hãy tìm đọc cuốn Bước chân Việt Nam - 4 cực, 1 đỉnh của “phượt quái” Ngô Huy Hoà, với cái nick đình đám hachi8 tích cực chia sẻ những chuyến đi, khung hình đẹp cùng cảm xúc của mình trên các diễn đàn và nhiều tạp chí du lịch. Cuốn sách ghi lại chi tiết trải nghiệm của Hoà trong các hành trình chinh phục bốn cực: Lũng Cú-Hà Giang (cực Bắc), Năm Căn - Cà Mau (cực Nam), A Pa Chải - Điện Biên (cực Tây), Mũi Đôi - Khánh Hoà (cực Đông) và đỉnh Phan Xi Păng hùng vĩ. Cùng với đó là hành trình xuyên Bắc Nam “một mình một ngựa” kỳ thú.\nBạn có thể coi đây là một cuốn nhật ký, và cũng là một cuốn cẩm nang với đầy đủ thông tin về cung đường, lịch trình, điểm đến,… Bạn sẽ chìm vào những cảnh tượng khi thì hùng vĩ, lúc lại tinh tế đầy màu sắc qua ống kính của chính tác giả. Không dễ để chụp lại được những tấm hình như thế. Với sự nhạy cảm và kỹ thuật chọn góc, căn hình của Huy Hoà, cảnh sắc dường như bừng bừng sống dậy trước mắt bạn. Thật khó có thể kìm lòng trước những tấm hình như thế.\nĐọc sách, bạn sẽ bắt gặp một anh chàng đầy đam mê, dám nghĩ, dám làm và cũng đầy tinh thần trách nhiệm. Dưới sự hướng dẫn anh chàng đó, bạn sẽ hình dung được khá rõ nét về các chuyến đi, những điều thú vị và khó khăn trên đường, những vấn đề cần lường trước và những kinh nghiệm mà người viết đã rút ra sau mỗi trải nghiệm... Bạn học được những điều cần chuẩn bị trước mỗi chuyến đi, và cũng học được rằng chẳng có sự chuẩn bị nào là toàn vẹn, hãy luôn giữ tinh thần tự chủ, linh hoạt khi đối mặt với những tình huống bất ngờ trên đường.\nBạn hãy đọc để cùng người viết cảm nhận từng tấc đất Việt Nam, để cùng yêu những con người Việt Nam, để sững sờ và mê đắm trước những khung cảnh lịm người trên chính đất nước mình. Đọc để rồi khát khao khám phá lại sôi lên, để rồi đi, để rồi cảm nhận niềm yêu nước hoàn toàn vô tư trào lên trong huyết quản. Và đặc biệt hơn, để thấy tâm hồn mình rộng mở sau mỗi cuộc hành trình.\n(Thanh Huyền)\n",

Hiểu một cách đơn giản, Doodle Art có thể coi là một dạng nghệ thuật của tiềm thức. Doodle ghi lại suy nghĩ thông qua hình ảnh một cách ngẫu hứng, không bị ràng buộc bởi bất kì mục đích và nguyên tắc nào cả. Doodle Art, xin được tạm gọi là “nghệ thuật nguệch ngoạc”, có thể hơi trừu tượng, hơi lộn xộn, hơi khó hiểu...cũng chẳng sao, vì đây là vẻ đẹp độc đáo của Doodle được tạo nên từ sức sáng tạo không giới hạn của tiềm thức.\nXin được giới thiệu tới các bạn cuốn sách Tô màu Nghệ thuật - TÍ HON XÂM LƯỢC - một tác phẩm cực kỳ thú vị được tạo nên bởi một “bậc thầy” về Doodle Art - Kerby Rosanes - một hoạ sĩ trẻ đầy tài năng người Philippines. \n",

    "description": "Tiếng Vọng Từ Những Linh Hồn là tập phóng sự của nhà báo Hoàng Anh Sướng kể lại hành trình tìm hài cốt của các nhà ngoại cảm như Phan Thị Bích Hằng, Năm Nghĩa, Phan Oanh...\nTâm linh với tư cách là một Bộ môn khoa học đã có những thành tựu nhất định trong cuộc sống, nhưng vẫn còn quá nhiều bí ẩn, xa lạ với nhân loại, thậm chí còn bị lợi dụng hoặc đánh đồng với mê tín dị đoan. Sau những tập phóng sự: Những chuyện kỳ bí về thế giới tâm linh, Bùa ngải xứ Mường, Hạnh phúc đích thực và bây giờ là Tiếng vọng từ những linh hồn, đó thực chất là cuộc hành trình khám phá, đi tìm “sự thật tâm linh” của nhà báo Hoàng Anh Sướng. Nhưng cái cách đi vào thế giới huyền bí còn những điều con người bất lực, không lý giải nổi và khoa học thì đang tiệm cận, Hoàng Anh Sướng đã đi theo lối riêng, không giống những người viết khác.\nCuộc sống và hiện tượng tâm linh nó vốn thế và sự thực đang như thế, Hoàng Anh Sướng chỉ chọn lọc những cái đặc sắc, riêng biệt nhất, nhưng sau khi cảm nhận được cái dị biệt đó thì anh lại nhận ra được cái chung, cái bình thường. Tôn trọng tận cùng hiện thực khách quan, anh không áp đặt ý muốn chủ quan, để người đọc tự nhìn nhận, đánh giá sự việc theo cách riêng của mình. Một chị Năm Nghĩa với hành trình đi tìm được hơn 5000 mộ liệt sĩ, có khả năng đặc biệt đối thoại được với những “người cõi âm”. Và cũng qua từng trang sách, chân dung nhà ngoại cảm Năm Nghĩa hiện lên không phải chỉ với tấm thân gầy, gương mặt âm u, khắc khổ, ưu phiền mà cả một đời sống người đàn bà giản dị, lam lũ nghèo khó, nỗi đau khắc khoải âm thầm đi tìm mộ đồng đội với một tình thương và niềm tin mãnh liệt.\nTập phóng sự Tiếng Vọng Từ Những Linh Hồn được viết với một bút pháp trầm tĩnh, sâu lắng gợi cho người đọc nhiều ngẫm nghĩ. Điều đặc biệt là cái chất phóng sự - nó là thể loại chủ đạo của báo viết, thì dưới ngòi bút Hoàng Anh Sướng lại trở nên có hồn văn Việt. Có những chuyện, những việc kỳ bí huyền ảo, chép thô mộc y nguyên cũng đủ sức hấp dẫn; lại có những trang phóng sự anh viết kỹ càng đến từng câu chữ, dồn nén tình cảm thành hồn văn lấp lánh. Giản lược tối đa tính thông tấn sự kiện, anh hướng ngòi bút chọn nhiều chi tiết lạ, dị biệt và cái nhìn nhân đạo để chứng tỏ, cắt nghĩa sự thật thế giới tâm linh.\nNếu không muốn mọi sự dở dang thì các bạn nên làm xong mọi việc trước khi đọc tập phóng sự Tiếng vọng từ những linh hồn. Tất nhiên, đừng nên đọc vào lúc ban đêm bởi không phải bạn sợ hãi những chuyện kỳ bí, huyền hoặc trong cuốn sách mà bạn sẽ thao thức mất ngủ vì quá nhiều điều nhân bản, Hoàng Anh Sướng viết ra buộc chúng ta phải ngẫm nghĩ về tình thương yêu.\n",

Nếu thực sự yêu nhau quý vị hãy vượt qua mọi trở ngại để đến và ở lại bên nhau đến giây phút cuối cùng.\nTình yêu là có thật, nếu chúng ta có thể trải đều.\"\n(Nhạc sỹ Vũ Thành An)\nVào giữa thập niên 60 của thế kỷ trước, chàng nhạc sĩ trẻ Vũ Thành An lần đầu ra mắt khán giả yêu nhạc Sài Gòn với ca khúc Tình khúc thứ nhất và được công chúng đón nhận nồng nhiệt. Tiếp nối thành công đó, loạt Những bài không tên ra đời đã đưa tên tuổi của Vũ Thành An trở thành một trong những tượng đài của dòng nhạc trữ tình trong làng nhạc Việt.\nChàng trai trẻ Vũ Thành An năm nào có lẽ sẽ không thể ngờ rằng, những nốt nhạc đớn đau, khóc cho những cuộc tình đã vỡ của mình lại có sức sống mãnh liệt, có thể làm lay động hàng vạn trái tim của biết bao thế hệ người yêu nhạc đến vậy. Người ta tìm đến nhạc của ông như một nơi chốn để vỗ về cho trái tim đã nhiều lần bị thương tổn. Để được đắm chìm trong những giai điệu da diết, nhẹ nhàng, uyển chuyển với những ca từ giản dị, dễ nhớ dễ đi vào lòng người. Đan xen trong đó là những thông điệp về tình yêu, về nỗi đau, về hạnh phúc của con người và của cuộc đời.\nTình Khúc Vũ Thành An - tập nhạc tuyển chọn 39 tác phẩm hay nhất, đặc sắc nhất trong sự nghiệp sáng tác của ông. Đây là tuyển tập được xuất bản tuyệt đối trung thành với ấn bản do chính tác giả ký âm và ghi lời hát cùng với ý nguyện “để làm tài liệu và cũng để sửa lại cho đúng những thiếu sót đã có ở các ấn phẩm âm nhạc từ tác phẩm của tôi đang lưu hành khắp nơi”.\nVới cuộc đời người nhạc sĩ, còn gì vui sướng hơn khi những đứa con tình thần của mình được đón nhận và yêu mếm, khi trái tim thổn thức nỗi niềm nhờ gió cuốn đi đã tìm thấy được những tâm hồn đồng điệu… Và chừng nào những đôi lứa yêu nhau “còn lưu luyến, còn đắng cay, còn hận còn đau” thì chừng đó những bản tình ca không tên của Vũ Thành An còn sống mãi…\n\n",

    "description": "Stephen Hawking đã khiến độc giả trên khắp thế giới phải sửng sốt bởi loạt sách rất được yêu thích về chủ đề khám phá những bí ẩn của vũ trụ. Giờ đây, có lẽ là lần đầu tiên nhà vũ trụ học thông thái nhất trong thời đại của chúng ta đang nhìn lại cuộc đời mình cũng như quá trình tiến bộ về tư duy khoa học của bản thân.\nTác phẩm Lược Sử Đời Tôi thuật lại chặng đường gần như không tưởng của Stephen Hawking, từ thời niên thiếu ở London sau chiến tranh cho đến giai đoạn ông trở nên nổi tiếng trên khắp thế giới và được ca ngợi. Với một lượng lớn hình ảnh chưa được công bố cùng lời chú thích ngắn gọn, hóm hỉnh và chân thật, Lược Sử Đời Tôi đã đưa độc giả đến với một Stephen Hawking được nói đến rất ít trong những cuốn sách trước đây: một cậu học sinh luôn tọc mạch được các bạn cùng lớp đặt cho biệt danh Einstein; một tay cá cược khi đã từng đánh cược với một đồng nghiệp về sự tồn tại của một lỗ đen đặc biệt, và một người cha, người chồng trẻ đang đấu tranh để có được một vị trí trong giới vật lý và vũ trụ học.\nVới sự khiêm tốn và hóm hỉnh chỉ có ở riêng Hawking, ông đã cho độc giả thấy được những thách thức mà ông phải đối mặt sau khi bị chẩn đoán đoán nhiễm chứng bệnh ALS ở tuổi hai mươi mốt. Miêu tả về sự tiến bộ của bản thân như một nhà tư tưởng, ông giải thích làm thế nào mà cuộc sống rất có thể phải sớm kết thúc của ông lại thôi thúc ông tiến lên để đạt được những bước đột phá về trí tuệ, đồng thời cũng nói về nguồn gốc kiệt tác Lược sử thời gian - một trong những cuốn sách tiêu biểu của thế kỷ 20.\nTinh tường, sâu sắc và khéo léo, Lược Sử Đời Tôi  mở ra cánh cửa cho chúng ta tiến vào vũ trụ của chính Hawking.\n",

Cuốn sách của Nyanaponika Thera được khởi thảo với niềm tin sâu sắc rằng sự trau dồi chánh niệm mang tính hệ thống có vai trò lớn lao trong tu tập thiền định, như được thuyết giảng trong kinh Niệm Xứ (Satipatthāna-sutta), một trong những bộ kinh trọng yếu nhất mà Ðức Phật đã thuyết giảng hơn 2500 năm trước.\nCon đường Quán niệm còn được gọi là Con đường Duy nhất (The Sole Way), do đó cũng là trái tim của thiền định Phật giáo, hay trái tim của Phật pháp. Trong kinh Niệm Xứ tồn tại sức sáng tạo cũng như sức hấp dẫn bất diệt và phổ quát của một giáo lý đích thực về Khai sáng. Ngày nay, tại phương Đông cũng như phương Tây, phép quán tứ niệm xứ được phổ biến rộng rãi, và các hành giả áp dụng phép quán này trong mọi hoạt động hàng ngày.\n",

    "description": "Mỗi thời đại đều sản sinh ra những nhân vật kiệt xuất, tên tuổi được lưu truyền trong nhân gian. Họ là những bậc vĩ nhân trên vũ đài chính trị, tư tưởng. Họ là những mỹ nhân nghiêng nước nghiêng thành có ảnh hưởng đến sự tồn vong của quốc gia. Họ là các danh họa, là những nhà văn, nhà thơ nổi tiếng… Tuy nhiên, cuộc đời và cả cái chết của họ với nhiều bí ẩn đã trở thành đề tài tranh cãi, là mảnh đất màu mỡ cho vô số giả thuyết từ thực tế đến không tưởng. Năm tháng qua đi, những điều bí ẩn ấy càng vùi sâu trong quá khứ thì càng khơi gợi sự tò mò của các thế hệ sau.\nQua những truyền thuyết về cuộc đời và cái chết của một số danh nhân, mỹ nhân, cuốn sách sẽ đề cập đến các biến cố lịch sử, những dữ liệu quá khứ và góc nhìn hiện tại để cố gắng vén bức màn đưa đến sự thật. Và hy vọng rằng, chúng sẽ trả lời được phần nào câu hỏi vì sao ngày nay chúng ta được thừa hưởng vô số tác phẩm nghệ thuật đặc sắc của những thời đại vàng son đã qua…\n",

    "description": "Một cuốn sách về phong tục Việt Nam khá đầy đủ và sâu sắc. Cuốn sách bao gồm 12 chương, mỗi chương gồm nhiều mục nhỏ. Cách phân chương rất mạch lạc và tiện cho người đọc khi cần tham chiếu, nhưng điều đáng giá của cuốn sách là ở chỗ những vấn đề văn hoá được đề cập một cách tự nhiên, lời văn duyên dáng mà vẫn mộc mạc. Tác giả còn làm sống lại kho tàng ca dao, tục ngữ, thơ, vè..., và cũng chính những câu ca dao, tục ngữ, thơ, vè....lại làm người đọc dễ nhớ, dễ thuộc.\nĐược viết vào những năm 60 của thế kỷ trước, Đất lề quê thói xứng đáng được xem như một bách khoa toàn thư thu nhỏ về văn hóa và phong tục cổ truyền Việt Nam. Qua từng trang sách, độc giả như được mời thả bước trong một bảo tàng dân tộc học mà tác giả là người hướng dẫn tận tình, sâu sắc, vừa duyên dáng, hóm hỉnh, để cùng trở về một không gian sống tuy gần gụi thân quen lại như đã thành quá khứ xa xôi tự thuở nào. Đâu chỉ là những câu chuyện về tâm tính người Việt, tục ma chay, cưới hỏi, cúng giỗ cỗ bàn hay nguồn gốc những kiêng khem mê tín... mà cả một thế giới tinh thần người Việt với những gìn giữ và thích nghi, thay đổi qua bao nhiêu thế hệ, lạc hậu mà phong phú, và vẫn giàu thành kính được tái hiện đầy đủ trong Đất lề quê thói.\n\"Có thờ có thiêng, có kiêng có lành\", trong bối cảnh cuộc sống vật chất và các giá trị đã thay đổi quá nhanh, quá nhiều qua mấy chục năm qua, hơn bao giờ hết, tác phẩm cảu Nhất Thanh Vũ Văn Khiếu càng cho thấy đất lề, quê thói vẫn ăn sâu vào tiềm thức người Việt.\n",

Theo xu hướng phát triển mạnh mẽ của công nghệ, Organ điện tử ngày càng được tích hợp thêm nhiều tính năng mới. Thực tế, một cây đàn Organ điện tử cao cấp có thể tạo ra hiệu quả âm thanh gần như một dàn nhạc nhẹ. Mặc dù có chức năng đệm hát rất nổi trội nhưng cho đến nay, chưa có nhiều tài liệu hướng dẫn cách đệm Organ điện tử một cách hiệu quả.\nCuốn sách Học đệm Organ do tác giả Cù Minh Nhật biên soạn sẽ lần lượt hướng dẫn học đệm hầu hết các tiết điệu nhạc nhẹ thông dụng.\nVới những người học đệm, có thể nói đây là cuốn sách rất thiết thực, vì mỗi bài đệm đều được trình bày sinh động trong CD-ROM  tặng kèm. Điều này giúp học viên hình dung cụ thể hầu hết các vấn đề đệm hát: từ cách chọn và cài đặt các dữ liệu (tiết tấu, âm sắc, tốc độ,...); ghi nhớ các nét giai điệu và hợp âm đệm; cho đến sự mường tượng khái quát về bố cục bài đệm (nhạc dạo, cách đảo trống cuối câu nhạc hoặc đoạn nhạc, cách dằn nhấn, cách kết bài,...).\n",

    "description": "5678 bước chân quanh hồ Gươm, cái tên đã nói lên không gian của cuốn sách mà nhà nghiên cứu Nguyễn Ngọc Tiến dựng nên. Từ những công trình kiến trúc xung quanh con đường ven mặt hồ trung tâm của Hà Nội trải từ xưa đến giờ, qua nhiều thế kỷ, những di tích, đường sá, những cây xanh và những con người gắn với hồ Gươm (còn gọi là hồ Hoàn Kiếm, mà người Hà Nội gọi tắt là Bờ Hồ), cuốn tản văn đã mở ra những chồng lớp lịch sử của một không gian văn hóa đặc sắc và độc nhất vô nhị.\nNhư chính tác giả đã tâm sự ở lời tựa, “Từ khi trở thành phóng viên báo Hà Nội mới, hồ Hoàn Kiếm càng quen thuộc với tôi vì tòa soạn nằm kế bên. Lúc rỗi việc, tôi thường thẩn thơ dạo quanh hồ và nhận ra rằng vẫn còn nhiều chuyện chưa viết. Đó là những chuyện truyền miệng, chuyện khó nói và có thể dưới mắt nhiều người nó lặt vặt song đôi khi nó là cái hồn của đời sống thị dân. Thế là ý tưởng cuốn sách 5678 bước chân quanh hồ Gươm ra đời từ năm 2002. Sở dĩ đặt tên sách như vậy vì tôi đi dạo quanh hồ Gươm hết từng ấy bước chân”. Cuốn sách bắt đầu theo tiến trình thời gian, bắt đầu từ tượng Lý Thái Tổ, vị vua có công đầu xây dựng Thăng Long, theo chiều kim đồng hồ mà kể.\n“Tuy nhiên, ngoài chuyện không đầu không cuối, tôi cũng lan man những điều tôi đọc trong sách, tôi chứng kiến và cảm nhận được về Thăng Long - Hà Nội”. Lối viết thoải mái, dạo chơi từ chuyện này sang chuyện khác cũng chính là thứ làm cho cuốn sách có sức hấp dẫn riêng. Mạch chuyện tuân theo tiến trình con đường vòng quanh Bờ Hồ, nơi cả hơn trăm năm qua chứng kiến bao sự thăng trầm của thời cuộc, nơi phô bày những nét đặc trưng của Hà Nội, từ đó những số phận được kể lên, hoặc ngậm ngùi thương cảm hoặc thanh thản tĩnh tại.\n",

    "description": "Văn hóa cổ đại Ấn Độ là một trong những nền văn hóa lâu đời và huy hoàng nhất của nhân loại. Thần thoại và sử thi là sản phẩm vĩ đại của nền văn hóa này. Qua những nghiên cứu hệ thống từ thần thoại đến các tác phẩm văn học cổ đại như Sơkuntơla, Rama và Sita, và tập sử thi đồ sộ nhất của nhân loại - Mahabharata, GS. Cao Huy Đỉnh, nhà nghiên cứu văn hóa dân gian hàng đầu Việt Nam, người đi đầu trong lĩnh vực nghiên cứu văn học dân gian Ấn Độ đã tạo nên một đường dẫn khám phá nền văn hóa vĩ đại của nhân loại, cũng như tạo điều kiện chỉ ra những mối ảnh hưởng của văn hóa Ấn Độ đến văn hóa cổ truyền Việt Nam.\nThần thoại Ấn Độ là sáng tác dân gian truyền miệng của nhiều chủng tộc, nhiều địa phương kế thừa lẫn nhau trong quá trình phát triển đất nước. Đó là một thế giới thần thoại kì ảo, được giữ trong các tập sách đồ sộ.\nTác giả Cao Huy Đỉnh đã nhận xét: “Mỹ cảm của người Ấn Độ bị hương khói của tôn giáo che mờ, bị tư biện triết học làm băng giá, bị phù chú và kinh kệ vùi dập. Chủ nghĩa duy tâm đã dẫn đến nguyên lí mỹ học phản hiện thực: lí tính siêu thực chỉ đạo cảm tính, cá nhân phải đồng hóa với vũ trụ, sự hưởng lạc cảm quan đi liền với chủ nghĩa khổ hạnh. Cuộc đời được miêu tả như trò chơi phù phiếm hay ảo mộng mà thượng đế bày đặt ra để thử thách con người. Thượng đế là chân thực, trần thế là hư vô. Quan niệm về hiện thực như thế là bị đảo lộn”.\nCuốn sách là tập hợp có tính khai mở cho việc nghiên cứu có hệ thống một nền văn hóa đặc thù, là sản phẩm mẫu mực cho một giai đoạn nghiên cứu mà tác giả đã vượt lên những khó khăn để đóng góp cho xã hội phần tinh hoa nhất của mình.\n",

Vassal - một phụ nữ người Anh lấy chồng là sỹ quan quân y người Pháp J.J. Vassal. Khi ông được bổ nhiệm làm việc ở Viện Pasteur Nha Trang, bà đã theo ông và có thời gian 3 năm ở đây. Trong khi ông bận rộn với công vụ và việc nghiên cứu những chứng bệnh nhiệt đới sau này sẽ làm ông nổi tiếng, bà đã thu vén công việc và để bớt nỗi nhớ nhà, bà đã bỏ công nghiên cứu cảnh vật quanh mình, thích thú tìm hiểu cảnh vật và con người. Bà quan sát cảnh quan, phong tục người An Nam với cặp mắt tinh tường rồi thuật lại một cách rõ ràng sinh động. Không chỉ quan sát, bà còn lặn lội đến tận nơi những dân tộc thiểu số sinh sống mà từ trước đến giờ ít ai biết rõ.\nNhững sinh hoạt hàng ngày, ngày Tết, tôn giáo và những tập tục mê tín dị đoan của người An Nam, vị trí của người đàn bà trong xã hội … được bà kể lại bằng giọng văn chân phương, dung dị với cả tấm lòng, bằng đôi mắt bao dung của một người phụ nữ Phương Tây. Nha Trang là một địa danh rất xưa. Nhưng để thành một nơi nghỉ mát nổi tiếng khắp bán đảo Đông Dương trong những năm 1930, Nha Trang đã bắt đầu một cách rất khiêm tốn. cái bình dị, khiêm tốn này như thế nào cách đây 100 năm?

    "description": "Thế giới đang bước vào một thời đại mới, con người đang trên hành trình nhận thức lại về bản thân và vũ trụ. Khi mà khoa học hiện đại dần mất đi tính thuyết phục của nó thì con người ngỡ ngàng nhận ra, mọi câu trả lời đã nằm sẵn ở một nơi sâu thẳm trong chính tâm thức của mình.\nTa là ai? Thật ra, bất cứ ai trong chúng ta cũng không chỉ là lớp da người này. Chúng ta đã sống hàng triệu năm, hàng tỷ năm. Về bản chất, chúng ta là những linh hồn không bao giờ chết. Những bậc thầy tâm thức thông qua trải nghiệm “con mắt thứ ba” và kết quả từ các công trình nghiên cứu, tư liệu ngoại cảm đã mở ra cho khoa học một chân trời mới…\nKhông có cái chết tập hợp nhiều bài viết của các bậc thầy trên con đường tâm thức như: các đạo sư Osho, Meher Baba, Yogananda, Ramana Maharshi, các nhà ngoại cảm Sylvia Browne, Alice A. Baley, Jane Roberts, Jz Knight… cùng rất nhiều các tiến sĩ khoa học, bác sĩ trị liệu, các nhà nghiên cứu tâm linh khác. Trên một phương diện nào đó, có thể nói cuốn sách này là một tập hợp những bằng chứng đầy thuyết phục, sinh động và hấp dẫn về sự tồn tại của LINH HỒN bất diệt.\nCác bài viết trong Không có cái chết được sắp xếp một cách khéo léo, đưa người đọc đi từ nhận thức chung về con người và vũ trụ cho tới những bài học, trải nghiệm mang tính cá biệt hơn. Do năng lực hữu hạn của cơ thể vật lý và những ảo tượng của thế giới vật lý che khuất tầm mắt, chúng ta không nhìn thấy được cách mà thực tại hiện hữu, nhưng các bậc thầy tâm thức thì không như vậy. Tâm trí trong sáng, hòa hợp với vũ trụ đã cho phép họ thấu tỏ nhiều bí mật, kết nối được với những thực thể cấp cao từ không gian khác. Và giờ đây, họ có mặt trong cuốn sách này để kể lại với chúng ta điều họ đã trải nghiệm.\nKhông có cái chết còn tập hợp bài viết của những người bình thường đã trải qua kinh nghiệm cận tử, xuất hồn, nghiên cứu về luân hồi và tái sinh... Có thể nói đây là một cuốn sách phong phú, nhiều góc nhìn về LINH HỒN - mà từ trước tới nay vẫn luôn là một ẩn số đối với con người trên Trái đất.\nNếu bạn là một người thực hành Thiền, cuốn sách này là không thể thiếu, nó sẽ hỗ trợ bạn thăng hoa trong những trải nghiệm Thiền định. Còn nếu bạn không phải, ít nhất cuốn sách cũng sẽ giúp bạn mở rộng cái nhìn về con người và thế giới, khởi sự cho một bước đột phá, một cơn bão cát, một cơn lốc xoáy của tâm thức - mà có thể bạn đang cần, để rũ sạch những bụi bặm ngày qua và bắt đầu cho hành trình mới...\n",

    "description": "\nCuốn sách của tác giả Dương Thanh Biểu là câu chuyện đẫm nước mắt, nhưng đầy cảm động về nhân vật lịch sử vẫn còn gây nhiều tranh cãi đến nay. Nhiều sự thật đã được làm sáng tỏ qua cuốn sách này. Đúng như tác giả cuốn sách đã viết ở phần kết: “Lịch sử là công bằng. Hãy công bằng với lịch sử. Một khi chưa có sự công bằng với quá khứ thì khó có công bằng với hiện tại và không dễ gì công bằng với tương lai”. Nhà phê bình Bùi Việt Thắng đã đánh giá cuốn sách như một “sách trắng” giải mã các sự kiện lịch sử liên quan đến nhân vật Tạ Đình Đề trong lịch sử cách mạng nước ta và lịch sử của ngành tư pháp. Còn nhà văn Hạ Bá Đoàn thì nhận xét: \"Tác phẩm đã thức tỉnh nhân tâm, lay động trái tim người đọc, thôi thúc mong ước phải thay đổi thái độ ứng xử với con người trong tiến trình đổi mới kinh tế - văn hóa và đặc biệt là đổi mới tư pháp.\n",

Mà mỗi cuộc chỉ để mải mê cảm nhận và hết mình trải nghiệm. Nhờ thế mà nhận ra những trầm tích văn hóa chợt lấp lánh dưới gót chân ngựa Mông (Việt) và Mông Cổ, trên đầu sư tử Pu Péo, trên trán những chú bò chọi, trong bùa yêu của Tây Bắc, trong lối đánh cồng Tây Nguyên, ở bia mộ vùng này, nơi cây mắm, cây đước vùng kia... Mỗi nét văn hóa ấy khác nào một thứ tinh thể của quá khứ tuy khuất chìm đâu đó nhưng vẫn tỏa ánh sáng khiêm nhường của nó trong hiện tại này.

Thông suốt được chỗ này, thì có thể một mình thênh thang trong vũ trụ.\"\n- VÔ  MÔN QUAN\nTrong cuộc khủng hoảng tinh thần của thế giới hiện đại, Thiền được đưa thành công vào một số lĩnh vực khoa học như y học, tâm lý học... để trị liệu hiệu quả nhiều loại bệnh, đặc biệt là các bệnh liên quan đến tinh thần, phụng sự rộng rãi hơn cho loài người. Như thế, Thiền có đơn thuần chỉ là một phương pháp trị liệu? Không, với tư cách là một trong những báu vật quý giá nhất mà Châu Á trao tặng cho thế giới, Thiền rộng lớn và sâu sắc hơn rất nhiều.\nVậy Thiền là gì? Đạo là gì? Vì sao cả nghìn năm qua, nó dường như vẫn vô cùng huyễn hoặc, thậm chí với không ít người Á Đông? Đó là câu hỏi không chỉ Allan Watts đặt ra. Nhưng ông đã dành phần lớn cuộc đời mình đi vào thế giới Đông Phương Minh Triết, kiếm tìm câu trả lời toàn diện nhất có thể trong khả năng của mình. Đơm hoa kết trái trên hành tinh đó là khoảng 20 cuốn sách có giá trị đã công bố. Đặc biệt phải kể đến Thiền đạo (1956) - chứa đựng tri thức uyên áo sâu sắc về Thiền và Đạo, như một kinh điển phi thời gian hé mở cho bao thế hệ độc giả Đông Tây cánh cửa của chân lý và giác ngộ, nợi cội nguồn phúc lạc và những tiềm năng lớn lao vốn thuộc về con người mà ta chưa chạm đến.\n",

    "description": "Tuyển tập nhạc Ngọn Lửa & Khát Vọng Việt Nam gồm 56 bài hát, được chia làm 3 chủ đề: Trái tim con gọi tên đất nước, Giọt yêu thương giữ lại và Như trẻ thơ reo hát giữa đời. Trong đó, chủ đề đầu tiên chiếm phần lớn trong tuyển tập này. Hầu hết đó là những giai điệu viết về quê hương, mang lại những cảm xúc trong trẻo, tươi mới, chạm vào sâu bên trong ngóc ngách tâm hồn. Từ “Ngọn lửa tuổi hai mươi” viết về nữ bác sĩ Đặng Thùy Trâm vừa tha thiết vừa mãnh liệt lại quá đỗi dịu dàng, đến “Tiếng hát nơi đảo xa” vừa hào hùng vừa khắc khoải. Nét nữ tính hòa cùng sự sâu sắc và tình yêu quê hương mãnh liệt, đã tạo nên những ca khúc lay động lòng người ở những đề tài được xem là “khó” diễn đạt thành công như tình yêu quê hương đất nước.\nCảm hứng về tình yêu quê hương đất nước được thể hiện rõ nhất trong các ca khúc mà nhạc sĩ Thanh Bình viết về biển đảo. Tất cả đều được bắt nguồn từ chuyến thăm Trường Sa vào tháng 4/2007 của chị. Theo chia sẻ của nhạc sĩ Thanh Bình, trước đây chị chỉ biết thông tin qua báo, đài nhưng lúc được đến với Trường Sa, được đến với những hòn đảo thân yêu của Tổ quốc chị đã vô cùng xúc động. “Nghe qua lời kể, đọc qua sách báo, hình ảnh, tôi đã không thể và không thể cảm nhận hết những khó khăn, thiếu thốn nơi đây. Chỉ đến khi được đặt chân đến hơn 10 đảo nổi, đảo chìm giữa trùng trùng biển khơi tôi mới thấy được” - chị chia sẻ.\nSự khác biệt trong cá tính âm nhạc của nhạc sĩ Thanh Bình thể hiện trong tuyển tập Ngọn Lửa Và Khát Vọng Việt Nam chính là sự tự do. Không quá gò bó vào khuôn khổ, không đi theo lối mòn, những ca khúc của chị luôn gây bất ngờ ở những quãng cao, quãng trầm hay sự nhấn nhá trong ca từ, khiến người nghe đi theo mạch cảm xúc của chị, không thể cưỡng lại sự xúc động dâng trào và từ đó, được chị truyền cho tình yêu quê hương đất nước thật sâu sắc, tự nhiên như dòng chảy của tình cha mẹ, ông bà. Có lẽ vì thế mà những ca khúc của nhạc sĩ Thanh Bình được đón nhận nồng nhiệt, đi cùng nhiều chương trình lớn và những giải thưởng lớn.\nTuyển tập Ngọn Lửa Và Khát Vọng Việt Nam trân trọng giới thiệu với bạn đọc chân dung một người nghệ sĩ giản dị với trái tim nghệ thuật ấm nóng, dạt dào, một tài năng được nuôi dưỡng, hun đúc trong gia đình có truyền thống nghệ thuật, đã tạo nên những tác phẩm âm nhạc khác biệt, độc đáo dành cho quê hương đất nước Việt Nam mến yêu.\n",

Khi chúng ta làm việc, nếu tâm vẫn trong sạch, không mọc rễ, thì khi đó ta đã đưa tâm về nhà. Ta đã về. Ta đã tới. Nhưng nếu ta làm điều không thiện, tâm ta mọc rễ thì ta đã đưa tâm đi xa nhà.\nBạn thường làm việc, thường tạo tác và tâm bạn có mọc rễ không. Không biết bạn thì sao, chứ tôi thì có. Và thường xuyên. Tôi ngồi viết và mọc rễ ở đây. Tôi giảng bài và mọc rễ trên hội trường. Tôi họp giao ban và mọc rễ ở cơ quan. Tôi ngồi thiền trà với bạn tu và mọc rễ ở đó. Tôi trồng hoa ngoài vườn và mọc rễ luôn ở vườn. Bao nhiêu năm nay là vậy. Và tôi càng ngày càng đi xa \"nhà\", càng ngày càng si mê. Càng ngày tâm càng phiền não. Tu mãi chẳng thấy kết quả mấy.\nChợt một ngày tôi nhận ra: nếu mình làm mà tâm không mọc rễ thì mới đúng. Và khi đó dù làm gì, ở đâu cũng không có bị đau khổ, không có phiền não. Hay thật. Phải thực tập ngay. Phải nhắc mình trồng hoa mà không cho mọc rễ. Nhắc mỗi ngày, mỗi giờ, mỗi phút, mỗi giây. Ngày xưa, tôi hay đi làm từ thiện. Rồi mọc rễ luôn. Rồi khoái đi làm từ thiện. Cái tôi càng ngày càng lớn. Có lúc còn cảm thấy mình nghiện đi từ thiện. Chợt giật mình: làm việc thiện mà mọc rễ thế này thì thành xấu mất rồi. Ngày xưa tôi hay tự hào về tính thương người, hay giúp người. Nhưng mỗi lần giúp ai là lại mọc rễ ở đó. Khi giúp rồi sau này nhờ lại người đó có khi họ không giúp, thế là bực mình. Giúp mà họ không cám ơn, thế là khó chịu. Tôi đã từng rất phiền lòng khi tặng cho người bạn một món quà quý mà sau đó bạn lại mang cho người khác.

Đặc biệt trong hai cuộc kháng chiến trường kỳ chống thực dân Pháp và đế quốc Mỹ, nhân dân Nam Bộ đã đứng lên kiên quyết với tinh thần quật khởi vô song. Đó cũng chính là tinh thần Nam Bộ kháng chiến bất diệt trên mảnh đất thành đồng Tổ quốc.\nCuốn sách tập hợp các bài viết giới thiệu về những người con anh tú của mảnh đất Phương Nam. Đó có thể là những văn nhân thi sĩ (Sương Nguyệt Anh, Trương Vĩnh Ký), chí sĩ yêu nước (Hồ Hảo Hớn, Nguyễn Đình Chiểu), những vị tướng tài (Trần Đại Nghĩa) hay các bậc hòa thượng có nhân cách sống cao đẹp (Thích Quảng Đức).... Tất cả khắc họa chân dung con người miền Nam với tâm hồn bình dị, tính cách bộc trực thẳng thắn, trượng nghĩa, hào phóng và lòng yêu nước nồng nàn.\n",

Văn chương và đức nghiệp của Nguyễn Trãi các danh tướng của bản triều không ai sánh bằng.”\nTư tưởng triết học của Nguyễn Trãi không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt lý luận khoa học, góp phần vào phát triển, hoàn thiện các khái niệm, phạm trù, các quan điểm tư tưởng triết lý trong lịch sử tư tưởng triết học Việt Nam, mà còn có ý nghĩa thực tiễn sâu sắc và thiết thực với yêu cầu lịch sử xã hội Việt Nam thời Lê sơ và thực tiễn xây dựng, phát triển và bảo vệ đất nước hiện nay; đặc biệt là tư tưởng nêu cao tinh thần tự hào, tự tôn và ý chí độc lập dân tộc, là lòng yêu nước, thương dân, thân dân và trọng dân của ông.\nCuốn sách gồm 3 chương:\nChương 1: Cơ sở xã hội và tiền đề lý luận hình thành tư tưởng triết học Nguyễn Trãi\nChương 2: Nội dung tư tưởng triết học Nguyễn Trãi\nChương 3: Đặc điểm và giá trị lịch sử trong tư tưởng triết học Nguyễn Trãi\n",

    "description": "Tiếp theo Tập 1 mang tên Các bộ trang trí điển hình phát hành năm 2012, tác giả Đinh Hồng Hải đã mang đến cho bạn đọc có một cái nhìn sâu sắc và mới lạ về các vị thần trong văn hóa truyền thống Việt Nam ở Tập 2: Các vị thần. Thông qua nội dung tập sách này, bạn đọc có thể nhận ra các vị thần trong vai trò những biểu tượng tồn tại trong đời sống văn hóa, được biểu hiện thông qua các hành vi tôn giáo và tín ngưỡng của con người. Qua đây chúng ta sẽ tìm thấy nguồn gốc và sự phát triển của các vị thần như Thần Đất, Thần Bếp, Thần Tài, Thánh Gióng, Di Lặc và Ông Trời trong văn hóa Việt Nam cũng như vai trò và vị trí của các vị thần này trong xã hội đương đại.\nTrong phần đầu của cuốn sách, tác giả đã đặt ra một loạt các câu hỏi khiến người đọc phải suy nghĩ: Tại sao người ta có thể bỏ ra tiền tỷ để cầu cúng, “trấn yểm” cho đất đai, nhà cửa, tài sản của mình nhưng rất ít người nghĩ xem mình có nhầm không khi chưa biết rõ tên gọi, nguồn gốc và “hành trạng” của vị thần mà mình đang cầu cúng, khấn vái? Liệu có việc đặt nhầm hoặc cúng nhầm vị thần nào đó không? Để trả lời cho những câu hỏi đó, tác giả hướng người đọc đến việc phải tìm hiểu nguồn gốc và quá trình phát triển của các vị thần cũng như các loại hình tín ngưỡng này trong chính nền văn hóa mà nó tồn tại.\nTừ những nghiên cứu dày công được thực hiện trong hơn 270 trang sách, tác giả Đinh Hồng Hải đã đi đến những nhận định hết sức xác đáng như: “... tôn giáo, tín ngưỡng là một phần quan trọng của văn hóa nhân loại nên sẽ không bao giờ mất đi. Vì vậy, sự tồn tại của tôn giáo, tín ngưỡng trong xã hội văn minh vừa mang tính tự nhiên vừa là một nhu cầu thiết yếu đối với đời sống tinh thần của con người.”\nCó thể nói, Các vị thần là chuyên khảo đầu tiên nghiên cứu một cách chuyên sâu và có hệ thống về đời sống văn hóa tín ngưỡng của người Việt từ trước đến nay. Cuốn sách không chỉ là một tài liệu tham khảo có giá trị cho các nhà nghiên cứu, nhà quản lý, giảng viên, sinh viên mà còn là một cuốn sách nên có trong tủ sách của mọi gia đình.\n",

Nếu có một thiểu số may mắn học hỏi được chút gì thì đã mấy người viết sách chia sẻ kinh nghiệm đó với chúng ta? Tất nhiên Lafcadio Hearn đã làm điều này, nhưng ông chỉ ghi nhận vài chi tiết huyền bí về châu Á. Alan Watts đi xa hơn trong việc tìm hiểu những giá trị tâm linh, nhưng ông cũng chỉ chú trọng về kỹ thuật và phương pháp chứ không đào sâu vào những phương diện khác. John Blofeld khác hẳn hai tác giả trên, ông không ghé thăm như một khách lạ mà sống hẳn ở đây gần trọn cuộc đời. Không những ông học hỏi và trải nghiệm nhiều, mà ông còn chia sẻ với chúng ta những vui buồn của kiếp người trong giai đoạn giao thời giữa Đông và Tây lúc đó.\nNgọc sáng trong hoa sen là cuốn sách nói về cuộc du hành của ông tại châu Á. Cho đến nay, dù thời gian trôi qua, nhiều sự kiện đã thay đổi nhưng Ngọc sáng trong hoa sen vẫn là một trong những cuốn sách giá trị về phương Đông và thường được dùng làm tài liệu tham khảo trong các trường đại học.\n",

Che xuất thân từ một gia đình trung lưu thuộc dòng dõi những người thích dấn thân vào những chuyện phiêu lưu, mạo hiểm.

Các đoạn văn, các ảnh, các trang nhạc đều có những mắt xích ngầm nối kết vào nhau mang một màu sắc mới mà mỗi chúng ta có thể tự khám phá, dò tìm và nhận thức theo cách riêng của mình. Lật giở từng trang sách, nhìn ngắm một bức ảnh, biết thêm một câu chuyện đời, chuyện nghề hay ngân nga giai điệu một bản nhạc… Bạn sẽ thấy và cảm nhận rõ nét hơn chân dung một Quốc Bảo của nước mắt và vinh quang, của văn và ảnh, nhạc và đời…\nBạn cũng sẽ cảm nhận rõ hơn những nông sâu của tâm hồn mình, những cảm xúc mơ hồ được gọi tên rõ nét, và mường tượng phần nào về một “Cuốn sổ trắng” của riêng mình!\nĐây sẽ là một cuốn sách “ám ảnh” tâm trí bạn. Hãy cùng đọc và cảm nhận, bạn nhé!\n\n",

    "description": "Con đường mây trắng là cuốn sách nổi tiếng nhất trong số hơn mười cuốn của bà Alexandra David Neel và ông Anagarika Govinda, hai người Tây phương đã sống nhiều năm ở Tây Tạng, tu tập thiền định và đi khắp nơi trong xứ sở huyền bí này hơn bất cứ người nước ngoài nào khác. Có thể nói, họ hiểu Tây Tạng với tất cả những khía cạnh tâm linh, tâm lý, địa lý nhiều hơn cả phần đông người Tây Tạng.\nVì sao Tây Tạng được cả thế giới quan tâm sâu sắc đến thế? Nơi đây chỉ có một câu trả lời duy nhất: Tây Tạng đã thành biểu tượng cho tất cả những gì mà nhân lại đã mất và đang có nguy cơ vĩnh viễn bị huỷ diệt.\nVới tập sách này, sẽ có nhiều lúc ta cảm nhận được Pháp Phật đang hiện diện nơi đây, dưới hình thức của cái đẹp bí ẩn, tinh tế và hài hoà của những từ và ngữ. Govinda đã mang bầu không khí linh thiêng, kỳ lạ nơi Tây Tạng, xứ sở của thánh thần, đến với chúng ta. Để nhiều năm nữa có trôi qua, những thánh tích hoang phế có bị chôn vùi, thì kẻ hành hương thiếu may mắn có thể từ tập sách này mà hiểu được rằng: thứ bị huỷ diệt chỉ là dạng hình vật chất, còn tinh thần ẩn sau những phiến đá đổ nát là thường hằng. Pháp Phật mãi mãi còn đó và sẽ thông qua những dạng hình khác, như một bức tranh, một cuốn sách… mà tới với thế gian.\n",

    "description": "Bạn đang cầm trên tay tập thứ ba của L’Officiel Việt Nam trong những ngày chớm thu, khi những tia nắng vàng cuối cùng của mùa hè đã bắt đầu ngả sang sắc nhàn nhạt. Đây cũng là thời điểm thế giới thời trang bắt đầu nhộn nhịp với những khuynh hướng Thu - Đông phơi bày vẻ đẹp của mùa mới lẫn những bức họa bằng vải được vẽ nên nhờ gu thẩm mỹ thiên tài. Đây là cuộc chơi của các bậc thầy về cấu trúc lẫn ảo thuật gia về màu sắc và họa tiết, định hình nên những xu hướng mà bạn sẽ bắt gặp và cập nhật cho chính bản thân từ giờ đến đầu năm sau. Đâu chỉ là trang phục, phong cách trang điểm cùng với gam màu son, màu mắt nhuốm sắc thu diễm lệ cũng trở thành đề tài không bao giờ nhàm chán cho mọi phụ nữ yêu cái đẹp.\n\nNhắc đến mùa thu, đến thời trang và làm đẹp, không thể không nhắc đến nước Pháp. Có biết bao nhiêu giấy mực đã hao tốn để ca tụng về nhan sắc và phong cách ăn mặc của phụ nữ Pháp. Mỗi cô gái ở Paris được ví von như một đại diện thương hiệu của chính bản thân mình. Họ tự tin vào bản thân, yêu chuộng vẻ khác biệt của mình và biết chỉ cho cả thế giới điều khác biệt ấy một cách không ngần ngại. Cô gái Paris không chạy theo xu hướng mà chính cô là người tạo nên xu hướng như cách Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot… và những nàng thơ Pháp khác đã từng làm. Một vài món đồ cơ bản được thêm thắt chi tiết theo cảm hứng và tính cách cá nhân, rồi khoác lên món trang sức đẹp nhất của người phụ nữ là nụ cười hay màu son đỏ, sự quyến rũ của phụ nữ Pháp toát ra từ bản năng và phong thái . Cho nên không lạ gì khi huyền thoại thời trang Diana Vreeland từng nói: “Bạn chỉ có thể ăn mặc phong cách khi sinh ra ở Pháp”.\n\nDẫu vậy, vẻ đẹp Pháp chỉ là câu chuyện để truyền tải một thông điệp rằng: vẻ đẹp khác biệt của bạn chính là kho báu quý giá nhất, sẽ tỏa sáng khi bạn học được cách tôn vinh chúng. Hãy đồng hành cùng L’Officiel để khơi dậy vẻ độc đáo trong bạn, để chính bạn, dù không phải sinh ra ở Pháp, cũng có thể trở thành một nàng thơ Pháp trên đất Việt.\n",

    "description": "Nếu bạn muốn nuôi dưỡng và giáo dục nên những chàng trai giỏi giang, trước tiên bạn phải dạy bé cách làm người. Dạy con làm người như thế nào, với mỗi bậc phụ huynh không chỉ cần kiến thức mà còn cần cả nghệ thuật. Hãy gieo hạt mầm của tình yêu thương và lòng hiếu thuận trong trái tim con bạn ngay từ khi còn nhỏ, để con bạn biết quan tâm, chia sẻ, biết thành thực, giữ chữ tín và có lòng biết ơn. Những phẩm chất quan trọng này chắc chắn sẽ theo con bạn trong suốt cuộc đời.\nCho phép con \"cố chấp\", vì đằng sau đó có thể là sự kiên trì. Cho phép con \"không nghe lời\", vì đằng sau đó rất có thể là sự sáng tạo. Các bé trai trên thế giới này mỗi người một vẻ, đứa trẻ nào cũng có những đặc điểm tính cách riêng của mình. Do vậy, cha mẹ nên tôn trọng những đặc điểm khác nhau của trẻ.\nKhông phải từ khi sinh ra con trai đã có tính ỷ lại, chính cha mẹ đã nuông chiều để con ỷ lại, dựa dẫm. Từ nay trở đi, đừng làm đồng hồ báo thức cho con, hãy để con tự đứng trên đôi chân của mình. Một đấng nam nhi phải biết tự làm chủ cuộc đời mình. Hãy để cho con bạn được là người đưa ra quyết định cuối cùng. Điều bạn cần làm là phân tích cái lợi cái hại để cho con không bao giờ phải hối hận, bởi vì sẽ đến một ngày con trai bạn phải sống độc lập, phải tự mình bước đi trên đường đời rộng mở. Sự che chở và nuông chiều quá mức của cha mẹ sẽ chỉ làm con trai mình kém cỏi hơn, trở thành một chú chim có đôi cánh mà không thể bay lên được.\n",

    "description": "Một hạt giống nhỏ đang nẩy mầm trong mảnh đất màu mỡ, được hấp thụ đủ lượng ánh sáng mặt trời, hơi ấm và độ ẩm sẽ phát triển thành một cây xanh khỏe mạnh giàu chất dinh dưỡng. Con nòng nọc của loại ếch sống trên cây biết phải sống bao lâu dưới nước và khi nào là lúc phải thay đổi đến một môi trường mới để sống trên cạn. Giống như cây cối, con người sơ sinh cần một môi trường đầy chất bổ dưỡng,về cả mặt vật chất lẫn tinh thần và sẽ lấy những thứ mà nó cần từ môi trường để phát triển. Cũng giống như con nòng nọc của loài ếch sống trên cây nó cần một môi trường có thể thay đổi theo từng giai đoạn phát triển của nó.\nĐứa trẻ sơ sinh được sinh ra với tất cả bản năng cần thiết để phát triển tốt và hạnh phúc khi nhu cầu của nó được đáp ứng; nhưng cái thứ môi trường nào mới thỏa mãn được những nhu cầu này? Cái ôm ấm áp của người mẹ vừa sau khi sinh đánh thức lòng nhân hậu và bắt đầu dạy đứa trẻ sơ sinh rằng con người nên cư xử với nhau như thế nào. Và rồi, sao nữa?\nQuyển sách này sẽ giúp cha mẹ tìm hiểu, khám phá, trân trọng và trợ giúp các nhu cầu tinh thần, vật chất và cảm xúc của đứa trẻ trong ba năm đầu đời.\nTrích đoạn\n\"Khóc là giao tiếp. Các nền văn hóa rất khác nhau trong cách phản ứng lại một đứa bé sơ sinh đang khóc - từ một niềm tin rằng khóc làm phổi bé khỏe hơn; đến sự ngờ vực tuyệt đối khi có người để mặc cho một đứa bé khóc một hồi lâu. Chúng tôi khuyên rằng bạn nên dành thời gian và nỗ lực để tìm hiểu về những gì bé đang nói với tiếng khóc. Không có công thức nào và mỗi đứa trẻ đều khác nhau.\nTrong một lần đến tham quan một bệnh viện nhi ở trường Đại học Roma trong khóa huấn luyện Hỗ Trợ Trẻ Sơ Sinh của tôi, tôi quan sát thấy một bác sĩ phản ứng lại với tiếng khóc của những đứa bé sơ sinh theo cách sau đây: Đầu tiên bà ta nói chuyện với đứa bé một cách êm ái và dịu dàng, để trấn an bé rằng có người đang hiện diện. Trong nhiều trường hợp, cách này là tất cả những điều cần thiết phải làm để an ủi một đứa bé và để làm bé nín khóc. Tuy nhiên, nếu điều này không có ích gì thì người bác sĩ đó nhìn vào mắt trẻ hoặc đặt tay lên người trẻ một cách nhẹ nhàng. Thường thì cách làm này hoàn toàn trấn an được đứa bé. Nếu không, bà ta kiểm tra xem có cái gì làm cho bé khó chịu, tấm trải bị nhăn, tả bị ướt, hay nhu cầu cần đổi tư thế nằm. Giải quyết được vấn đề này gần như lúc nào cũng trấn an được đứa bé và chấm dứt nhu cầu phải khóc của nó. Chỉ rất hiếm khi trẻ thực sự cần thức ăn.\"\n\n",

Ta càng làm nhiều lại càng thấy có nhiều việc phải làm. Ta càng cố chạy theo các xu hướng nuôi dạy con mới lại càng phải chịu nhiều áp lực và lo lắng. Ta càng muốn đơn giản hóa mọi thứ, thì mọi thứ lại có vẻ càng khó khăn và phức tạp hơn.\nRồi ta thắc mắc vậy rốt cuộc vai trò của người mẹ là gì. Bạn có nghĩ rằng những việc khó khăn và phức tạp ta đang làm là do nghe từ người khác, một chuyên gia về lĩnh vực nuôi dạy trẻ hay các bà mẹ khác sống quanh ta chẳng hạn? Có bao giờ trong đầu bạn xuất hiện vô vàn câu tự chất vấn, \"Mình đang làm gì thế này? Liệu thế có phải là đúng đắn không? Ai cũng làm thế nên mình cũng phải làm theo sao? Việc làm mẹ có khó đến thế không?\" Việc nuôi dạy con ta đang làm có thể hiện con người thật của ta không, có thể hiện niềm tin, bản năng, hay điều ta tin là đúng cho đứa trẻ khác biệt và duy nhất của mình không?\nBạn sẽ tìm được câu trả lời cho tất cả những câu hỏi trên qua cuốn sách Mẹ Mĩ Nuôi Con Thật Nhàn.\n",

Mỗi tội nàng cứ lơ tơ mơ - như thể con ốc vít nào đấy trong đầu nàng bị thay thế bằng cái nấm rơm bé xíu và trơn nhẫy. (Ví dụ mới đầu nàng rủ rỉ với mẹ “đơn vị của cái ghế là \"cái\". Mẹ mừng rơn vì thấy con “trí tuệ phết”, bèn bảo tối về con đố bố xem bố có biết không. Một phút sau mẹ thấy mặt nàng đầy dấu chấm hỏi: \"Có mấy cục ghế? Ủa đúng không nhỉ\". Thế rồi đến lúc bố đi làm về, nàng chạy ào ra ra hỏi, quên cả chào bố như thường lệ: \"Đố bố ghế nhà mình có mấy BÁT?’’. Tóm lại vịt cả là cô nàng không-chịu-nổi-sự-tập-trung.\nVịt thứ tên Su, 3 tuổi, vì đã quen với chuyện nuôi con nhỏ, nên bố mẹ chăm vịt thứ có phần “thả lỏng hơn”. Thế là chị ta trở thành Nữ thần tự do của nước Vịt. Sợ bị bố mẹ mắng nên chị Cả làm việc gì cũng thận trọng, rón rén; còn chị Thứ thì ngược lại. Chị tỉnh bơ làm mọi trò mà chị Cả không dám làm. Như cho đũa vào cốc ngoáy lộn lên. Mẹ thấy thế liền bảo: \"Này con, đừng cho đũa vào cốc”. Nàng tỉnh rụi: “Ơ nhưng mà con thích làm thế”. Khi đi siêu thị, chị Thứ cũng luôn là đứa lủi nhanh nhất.

Sẽ không có bất cứ công thức nào được đưa ra trong cuốn sách này, nhưng  bạn sẽ tìm thấy tất cả những điều cần thiết giúp trẻ ăn uống đúng cách ngay từ lúc lọt lòng. Những kết quả nghiên cứu và kiến thức mới về dinh dưỡng đều được đưa vào ấn bản này.\nCuốn sách không chỉ đề cập đến việc con bạn ăn gì, mà điều quan trọng không kém chính là việc cha mẹ và con cái sẽ cùng nhau thực hiện việc đó như thế nào. Bạn sẽ hiểu được, tại sao trong rất nhiều gia đình, việc ăn uống lại trở thành áp lực. Điều đó sẽ không xảy ra nếu mỗi thành viên nắm được và duy trì các quy tắc đơn giản: quy tắc ăn uống đúng cách.\nTất cả mọi thứ đều xoay quanh các quy tắc này. Đó không phải là các quy tắc tự nghĩ ra, mà là những quy tắc khoa học. Càng tìm hiểu sâu về chúng, bạn sẽ càng thấy chúng lôgic hơn. Ngoài ra, rất nhiều ví dụ sống động, cũng như các lời khuyên được đề cập, nhằm giúp bạn vận dụng các quy tắc trên phù hợp với độ tuổi của con cái mình.\nCuốn sách cũng đề cập đến vai trò của bố mẹ trong việc ăn uống của con cái được miêu tả rõ ràng như sau:\nMón gì? Bạn sẽ vận dụng kiến thức về dinh dưỡng đúng cách của mình để quyết định: Hôm nay nấu những món gì?.\nKhi nào? Bạn sẽ xác định thời điểm, số lần cho trẻ ăn những món mà bạn đã chuẩn bị.\nNhư thế nào? Bạn sẽ quyết định những nguyên tắc ứng xử trên bàn ăn. Những hành vi nào của trẻ bạn cho phép hoặc không cho phép? Bạn yêu cầu trẻ thực hiện những nguyên tắc đó.\nNgoài ra, bạn có nhiệm vụ đảm bảo không khí trong bữa ăn luôn dễ chịu, làm gương cho trẻ và cùng thưởng thức bữa ăn với gia đình.\n",

Tuy nhiên thực tế lại không như vậy. Từ khi còn nhỏ, trẻ em đã là những cá thể riêng và biết rõ chúng muốn gì, thậm chí còn biết rõ hơn những gì chúng không muốn. Chúng sẵn sàng cự nự với bố mẹ để được làm  theo ý thích của mình. Chúng ta, những bậc phụ huynh, cần phải chịu đựng điều này và không hề đơn giản bởi trên thực tế trẻ em có hệ thần kinh tốt hơn chúng ta.\nCha mẹ cần cho con cái tất cả những gì chúng thật sự cần. Nhưng có nên cho chúng những  thứ chúng muốn? Không phải tất cả những gì trẻ em muốn đều tốt cho bản thân chúng.\nChúng ta là người lớn. Chúng ta có trách nhiệm phải quyết định: Con cần gì - Con muốn những gì? Ta phải làm gì khi con không chịu làm những điều lẽ ra chúng phải làm? Hay khi chúng không  chịu ngưng tay chân dù ta đã nhắc nhở chúng? Làm sao để ta có thể cùng lúc vừa  giữ được  bình  tĩnh  nhưng vẫn công bằng?\nTất cả những câu hỏi này sẽ được trả lời trong cuốn sách với ví dụ cụ thể lấy từ những tình huống khủng hoảng và xung đột hàng ngày mà các cha mẹ thường gặp với trẻ từ 2 tuổi trở lên.\nVới kinh nghiệm nhiều năm trong lĩnh vực nghiên cứu và vận dụng kiến thức về tâm lí trẻ nhỏ, cũng như quá trình tiếp xúc với  rất nhiều trẻ em và các bậc cha mẹ, qua cuốn sách này tác giả cung cấp những phương pháp hữu ích để giúp cho các bậc phụ huynh có thể giải quyết những vấn đề nảy sinh trong quá  trình trưởng thành của trẻ.  \n",

Tuy  nhiên,  thằng bé lại là “nỗi kinh hoàng” trong lớp học.\nCác bà mẹ cảm thấy lo lắng và nhìn với ánh mắt hết sức cảnh giác về phía đứa con bé bỏng  của  mình  mỗi  khi Patrick tiến đến gần. Sau đó, vẫn như mọi lần, thằng bé ra đòn nhanh như chớp và “nạn nhân” khóc ré lên. Nhiều lúc Patrick còn cắn những đứa bé khác mạnh đến nỗi hai tuần sau vết răng vẫn còn nhìn rõ. Thậm chí nó còn giật đồ chơi từ tay những đứa bé khác rồi ném đi hoặc phá hỏng. Cũng có  lúc  Patrick  tỏ  ra  ngoan ngoãn và chơi đùa với những đứa  trẻ  khác. Nhưng  rồi  lại chẳng ai nhận ra nó là  đứa bé ngoan nữa. Còn mẹ của Patrick  thì sao? Với bà, Patrick là một đứa bé tuyệt vời. Bà mẹ hết mực chiều chuộng cậu quý tử. Sau khi có hai bé gái, cuối cùng bà cũng sinh được một bé trai. Bà dồn hết thời gian, tiền bạc và tình  thương  yêu cho con. Bà chưa từng đánh mắng hay giật đồ chơi từ tay thằng bé rồi phá hỏng cả. Vậy mà thằng bé liên tục làm vậy với những đứa trẻ khác. Tại sao lại như vậy?\n\"Giáo dục là gương mẫu và tình thương - và  chỉ  có vậy\" -  đây là câu nói của Friedrich Froebel - người đặt nền móng cho phong trào giáo dục mầm non vào đầu thế kỷ XIX. Nhưng câu  nói này không hề đúng với Patrick và mẹ cậu bé.\nChúng ta có thể làm gì để ngăn bọn trẻ làm những điều chúng không nên làm? Mặt khác, làm sao chúng ta có thể khiến chúng làm những thứ mà  bản  thân  chúng  không muốn làm - đó  là  những việc được coi là \"rắc rối\" mà chúng  ta - các bậc cha mẹ - thấy quan trọng và cần thiết? Chúng ta có thể làm gì khi những lời lẽ tốt đẹp đều không đem lại hiệu quả?\nNhận định\n\"Tôi thấy thật nhẹ nhõm khi nhận được cuốn sách này.\nGiờ tôi có thể tự tin nói rằng: “Hãy  thử  tìm  đọc  về  vấn  đề của  quý vị theo các chương trong cuốn sách này.

Cô con gái lớn tên Non là đứa trẻ hiền lành, ít nói còn cậu em trai của Non là Dai lại là một đứa trẻ rất tinh nghịch. Mỗi ngày bà đều phải “đau đầu” để suy nghĩ cách nuôi dạy sao cho phù hợp với hai đứa trẻ con mình.\nMặc dù đứa trẻ nào cũng đều chui ra từ bụng mẹ nhưng mỗi đứa lại có một tính cách khác nhau. Đứa thì ít nói, đứa thì y như trẻ con hay nhõng nhẽo, đứa thì nghiêm trang, chín chắn như người lớn… Đứa thì đi đâu cũng lẽo đẽo theo mình, đứa thì nghịch ngợm, đi đâu cũng tự mình đi… Chắc cũng có lúc bạn cảm thấy khó hiểu và thích ứng với bọn trẻ. Nếu bạn có những vấn đề như  đã đề cập thì đừng lo lắng. Chúng ta có thể giải quyết những điều đó qua những thông tin được chia sẻ trong cuốn sách này.\nMỗi đứa trẻ là một bài toán đố mà chúng ta phải đi tìm câu trả lời. Với phương pháp “hiểu cách phân loại trẻ” được trình bày cụ thể trong cuốn sách này, các bậc phụ huynh sẽ tìm được phương pháp phù hợp trong quá trình nuôi dạy con cái và hãy áp dụng nó như một “chiến thuật” hợp lí.\nCuốn sách gồm những nội dung như sau:\nLời mở đầu\nChương 1: Tìm hiểu về các loại tính cách của trẻ\nChương 2: Ba phút để hiểu trẻ : Các nhóm trẻ và cách ứng xử\nChương 3: [Phân loại] Không còn bực tức – Công thức của kỷ luật\nChương 4: [Phân loại] Gần gũi con nhiều hơn với nụ cười ấm áp\nChương 5: [Phân loại] Bài học sáng giá giúp cuộc sống hạnh phúc hơn\nLời kết\n",

Tôi đã không thất vọng. Đây chính là cuốn sách cần cho tất cả mọi người, tất cả những người sống với trẻ em, để họ biết mình đang làm gì, nên làm gì và những việc mình làm sai tác động đến con trẻ như thế nào”.\n(Lê Mai Hương, giáo viên Montessori, Casa Hanoi)\n“Tôi cảm thấy mình thật may mắn khi đã được đọc cuốn sách này trước khi con bước vào lứa tuổi đầy nghịch ngợm, thích khám phá thế giới xung quanh. Và tôi đã để cho con tự do vui chơi, tự do khám phá thế giới nhỏ của mình - việc của tôi là luôn dõi theo những trò nghịch ngợm của con và chỉ hỗ trợ cho con khi cần thiết. Con trai tôi đã 4 tuổi và con đã được lớn lên trong sự yêu thương và tự do, rất nhanh nhẹn như nhiều người đánh giá. Chính vì thế mà tôi muốn cảm ơn tác giả của cuốn sách này - nhà giáo Tôn Thụy Tuyết”.\n(Độc giả Nguyễn Thị Thu Hiền, Quảng Nam)\n",

    "description": "Giáo dục trẻ em là vấn đề đang được toàn xã hội quan tâm, đặc biệt phương pháp giáo dục thúc ép còn gây ra nhiều tranh cãi. Từ những nghiên cứu kỹ lưỡng trong thực tế, kết hợp tham khảo ý kiến của nhiều chuyên gia tâm lý nổi tiếng, tác giả Tanith Carey cho ra đời cuốn sách Thuần hóa cha mẹ hổ với phương pháp nuôi dạy con khoa học, phù hợp.\nTanith Carey là nhà báo, nhà viết sách nổi tiếng với những giải thưởng cao quý trong ngành. Bà là người tiên phong trong việc phản đối những quan điểm sai lệch về cách giáo dục con cái của các bậc cha mẹ ngày nay. Quan điểm của bà đã được phổ biến rộng rãi trên hàng loạt tờ báo thế giới: The Guardian, The Indepent, The Indepent on Sunday, The Daily Mail Grazia Woman and Womant Own and The new York Daily new…\nThuần hóa cha mẹ hổ được đánh giá là một trong những cuốn sách hay nhất về những quan điểm giáo dục sai lệch của các bậc làm cha mẹ.\nTrong phần 1 của cuốn sách, tác giả đưa ra những dẫn chứng cụ thể để chứng minh rằng vì sao “cha mẹ hổ” là trở thành xu hướng phổ biến trên toàn cầu hiện nay. Đồng thời chỉ ra rằng một trong số những nguyên nhân khiến các bậc cha mẹ có phương pháp giáo dục hà khắc với con cái là bởi sự kỳ vọng mà họ dành cho con là quá lớn, họ mong muốn con mình có thể trở thành “thần đồng” ngay khi ở trong nôi. Hoặc nguyên nhân đó còn đến từ “sự trỗi dậy của việc học phụ đạo” ở trẻ,…\nMặt khác, ở chương 2 của sách, tác giả Tanith Carey chỉ ra những mối nguy hại ghê gớm của phương pháp nuôi dạy con cạnh tranh, áp lực đang ảnh hưởng đến trực tiếp đến trẻ như thế nào. Không chỉ gây ảnh hưởng đến mối quan hệ gần gũi, gắn bó giữa cha mẹ và con cái, phương pháp này còn gây ra hậu quả nghiêm trọng mà nhiều bậc cha mẹ không thể lường trước được. Hàng loạt dẫn chứng về trẻ em bị stress nặng, mắc các bệnh tâm lý như trầm cảm, tự kỷ, tự ngược đãi bản thân,… và đặc biệt tỉ lệ trẻ em tự tử đã gia tăng ở Anh. Chính những con số này là lời cảnh tỉnh cho biết bao bậc làm cha mẹ cần phải xem xét lại phương pháp giáo dục con của mình.\nVà cuối cùng, trong chương 3 tác giả đưa ra những gợi ý cho các bậc làm cha mẹ có cái nhìn mới hơn về phương pháp giáo dục con. Dành thời gian và suy nghĩ cho con nhiều hơn, hiểu được rõ tầm quan trọng của việc chơi đùa,đừng bao giờ biến bài tập thành trận chiến, học cách nói với con, thường xuyên đưa ra những lời khen ngợi hợp lý,… Đó là cách để kết nối, thắt chặt tình cảm giữa cha mẹ và con cái dễ dàng hơn bao giờ hết. Thông điệp cuối cùng mà tác giả muốn gửi tới các bậc cha mẹ “không bao giờ là quá muộn” để học cách yêu thương và mang đến cho con những điều tuyệt vời, hạnh phúc nhất trong cuộc sống.\n",

    "description": "Đôi khi trong cuộc sống, chúng ta không tránh khỏi vấp ngã. Thật khó để có thể luôn giữ được nụ cười cũng như trạng thái tâm lí tích cực. Sẽ có lúc bạn phải đối mặt với những tình huống như bị nói xấu, bị từ chối hay trở thành nạn nhân hứng chịu cơn giận dữ của người khác. Trong những trường hợp như vậy, hầu hết mọi người đều khó giữ được bình tĩnh và có xu hướng phản ứng lại một cách tiêu cực, mặc dù điều đó chẳng đem lại chút lợi ích nào ngoài việc khiến cho mọi chuyện trở nên tồi tệ hơn.

    "description": "Mỗi người là một cá thể của xã hội. Con người không thể sống một mình mà cần được đặt trong các mối quan hệ xã hội. Khi bạn liên hệ với những người khác nghĩa là bạn đang giao tiếp với họ. Do đó, con người sẽ phải sử dụng ngôn ngữ nói hoặc viết. Ngôn ngữ giúp chuyển tải nội dung của thông điệp một cách rõ ràng từ người nói đến những người tiếp nhận. Tuy nhiên, nếu chỉ sử dụng từ ngữ đơn thuần, bạn sẽ khó lòng diễn đạt được hết ý tưởng của mình. Để làm rõ nghĩa của các từ hơn, chúng ta cần sử dụng ngôn ngữ cơ thể - một loại ngôn ngữ không lời.\nCon người thường sử dụng hầu hết các ngôn ngữ cơ thể của mình trong giao tiếp. Đơn giản như khi nói chuyện, bạn không chỉ giao tiếp bằng lời nói mà còn giao tiếp bằng ánh mắt. Nói cách khác, nếu bạn nhìn vào mắt đối phương khi đang trò chuyện, việc giao tiếp sẽ có hiệu quả tốt hơn. Nhìn chung, ngôn ngữ cơ thể thường được bộc lộ một cách vô thức. Nếu bạn biết rèn luyện để sử dụng chúng có mục đích hơn, bạn sẽ gây được ấn tượng tốt với mọi người. Sự thể hiện ngôn ngữ cơ thể tuỳ thuộc vào các tình huống, văn hoá và mối quan hệ của những người đang giao tiếp với nhau. Tóm lại, ngôn ngữ cơ thể được sử dụng để biểu lộ cảm xúc.\nCuốn sách nhỏ  này giới thiệu tới bạn đọc 55 cách sử dụng ngôn ngữ cơ thể để có thể gây ấn tượng và đạt hiệu quả cao trong giao tiếp.\n",

Ở Việt Nam ngày càng nhiều các bậc cha mẹ quan tâm, tìm hiểu phương pháp này. Cuốn sách thể hiện tư tưởng giáo dục thời kì sau của Maria Montessori. Trong thời kỳ này, bà đã dự đoán được những lý luận về trẻ em của mình sẽ được toàn thế giới quan tâm. Điều khiến người ta ngạc nhiên là tư tưởng của bà vượt xa những đồng nghiệp trong giới tâm lý học và giáo dục cùng thời với bà.\nThe Absorbent mind - Sức thẩm thấu của tâm hồn hé mở nền tảng tư tưởng của phương pháp giáo dục Montessori nổi tiếng toàn cầu, đang được áp dụng tại hơn 5000 trường học của Mỹ, Ấn Độ, Nhật Bản, Thụy Điển… góp phần tạo ra cuộc “cách mạng giáo dục” trên thế giới. Cuốn sách được tiến sĩ Maria Montessori viết ra dựa trên kết quả quan sát tỉ mỉ và đánh giá chuyên sâu những hiện tượng giáo dục có ý nghĩa quyết định xuất hiện trong cuộc sống của trẻ từ 0 - 6 tuổi. Trong đó khẳng định: Trẻ có khả năng tự học hay nói cách khác “tâm hồn” trẻ có khả năng “tự thẩm thấu” kiến thức, tình cảm… Do đó không cần ai dạy trẻ, trẻ hoàn toàn có thể “tự dạy chính mình”.\nMột cuốn sách đáng được đọc kỹ càng tới từng chữ, bởi vì “quan điểm” tác giả nêu ra dường như càng phát huy tác dụng trong thực tế, thậm chí hiệu quả của nó vượt xa sự mong đợi của chính tác giả.\n",

Chúng tôi rất xin lỗi vì sự đông đúc này. Mong quý khách thông cảm.”\nTàu điện chật ních người vào giờ cao điểm. Tuy có hơi vất vả một chút nhưng mấy lời thông báo kiểu lãnh đạm của các nhân viên phục tàu làm cho tôi cảm thấy khỏe hơn, tâm trạng cũng tốt hơn nhiều nữa.\nĐúng vậy, đây chính là lời nhắn “khích lệ”.\nLà “Sự khích lệ” mà tôi đang truyền đạt tới các mẹ trong việc nuôi dạy con cái.\nĐể khích lệ con, thì người ta cho rằng “khen ngợi” sẽ rất tốt đúng không nào? Vì thế, những người cha người mẹ như chúng ta sẽ tìm kiếm những “điểm đáng khen” để khen con trẻ.\nThế nhưng, ta chỉ khen khi bé làm được gì đó đặc biệt. Chẳng hạn như khi con được 100 điểm bài kiểm tra thì chúng ta sẽ nói: “Con của mẹ giỏi quá!”, khi con vượt qua bài thi lên cấp trong môn bơi lội thì chúng ta nói: “Con giỏi lắm!”, khi con lau bàn giúp chúng ta thì ta sẽ nói: “Con thật là đứa bé ngoan”…\nKhi con làm được một việc gì đó, ta sẽ khen: “Giỏi lắm”, “Tốt lắm”, “Con là đứa bé ngoan”, “Thật là tuyệt vời”, “Tuyệt quá!”.\nViệc khen ngợi rất quan trọng. Thế nhưng, nếu chỉ khen thôi thì các bạn nghĩ sẽ ra sao? Sự thật là, việc nuôi dạy con mà chỉ có khen ngợi không sẽ gây ra tác dụng phụ.\nNgược lại với đó, “Khích lệ” không phải chỉ khi con làm được một điều gì đó đặc biệt, mà cả khi con làm những việc rất bình thường, hay khi con thất bại, đó là những lời mà chúng ta có thể nói vào bất cứ lúc nào.\nVí dụ về chuyến xe điện lúc trước cũng giống như vậy đúng không nào? Không phải là việc chúng ta được khen, nhưng đó là những lời khiến cho chúng ta cảm thấy phấn chấn hơn. Nếu chúng ta nhận được những thông điệp kiểu như “Tôi luôn dõi theo bạn”, “Anh biết là em đang cố gắng rất nhiều”, “Lúc nào anh cũng ủng hộ em”…thì “Chiếc cốc trái tim” của chúng ta sẽ được lấp đầy bằng năng lượng của sự khích lệ và chúng ta sẽ tự nhủ rằng “Cố lên!”. Chúng ta sẽ trở nên vui vẻ. Đó là những lời như vậy đấy.\"\n(Ayako Harada)\n",

Tuy nhiên, ít người biết rằng nền tảng trí tuệ và tinh thần của trẻ được xây dựng và phát triển từ rất sớm, không phải từ cấp trung học hay tiểu học mà từ trước cả lúc chào đời - tức là ngay khi trẻ còn nằm trong bụng mẹ. Từ khi còn là thai nhi, trẻ đã có những khả năng kỳ diệu. Kinh nghiệm dân gian và cả khoa học hiện đại đều công nhận điều này, từ đó hình thành một phương pháp độc đáo nhằm tăng cường năng lực đặc biệt cho trẻ: Thai giáo. Các nhà khoa học đã khẳng định rằng: Thai giáo là một phương pháp hết sức hữu hiệu để tối ưu hóa khả năng tư duy của trẻ, phát triển trí não, ổn định tâm sinh lý…, tạo cơ sở để tiếp tục quá trình giáo dục sau khi trẻ ra đời.\nAi đã từng làm mẹ tất cảm nhận được khả năng “học hỏi”, tương tác với mẹ hoặc phản ứng với môi trường của con mình từ những tháng đầu thai kỳ. Rất nhiều người mẹ đã trải nghiệm cảm giác như có sợi dây liên kết mẹ con được thiết lập từ khi mang thai và duy trì cho đến sau khi trẻ chào đời, được dân gian gọi một cách trìu mến là “tình mẫu tử”. Bằng các phương tiện y khoa hiện đại, khoa học cũng xác nhận rằng thai nhi 4 tháng tuổi đã phát triển các giác quan, có khả năng ghi nhớ và học tập. Chính vì thế mà gần đây, ở nhiều nước tiên tiến trên thế giới như Mỹ, Nhật, Pháp, Anh…, Thai giáo được rất nhiều nhà khoa học nghiên cứu ngày càng chuyên sâu.\nĐầu tư giáo dục ở giai đoạn thai kỳ đúng là “một vốn bốn lời”: giúp phát triển thể chất và tinh thần của trẻ; giúp tu dưỡng tâm tính cho cha mẹ trẻ; giúp gia đình hạnh phúc hơn và góp phần vào tiến bộ xã hội. Ý nghĩa tích cực và những giá trị to lớn mà Thai giáo mang lại là không thể phủ nhận, dù theo quan niệm phương Đông hay phương Tây.\nQuyển sách Thai giáo - Dạy con từ trong bụng mẹ chia sẻ các kỹ năng Thai giáo dành cho các bà mẹ mang thai, các ông bố đang đón đợi con ra đời, các ông bà đang mong cháu để ẵm bồng - những người luôn mong chờ một em bé khỏe mạnh, thông minh, phát triển toàn diện cả về thể chất và tinh thần. Mong rằng cẩm nang nhỏ này sẽ đồng hành cùng bạn trong khoảng thời gian chín tháng diệu kỳ, cải thiện cuộc đời con bạn, và hơn thế nữa, mang lại hạnh phúc và niềm vui bất tận cho gia đình bạn.\n",

    "description": "Tự nhận mình không có năng khiếu về chụp hình, quay phim, hội họa giống như các anh chị trong gia đình, Phoenix Ho chọn cách ghi dấu những kỷ niệm về con qua các đoạn văn ngắn để chia sẻ cho gia đình và bạn bè thân thuộc ở Mỹ. Những bài viết của chị lần lượt được đăng tải trên Facebook bằng hai thứ tiếng: Việt và Anh (sau này chị dùng tiếng Việt là chủ yếu) đã nhận được sự đồng cảm và chia sẻ của rất nhiều người. Và ngày hôm nay, những câu chuyện mà tác giả Phoenix Ho gọi là “các đoạn văn ngắn” đã được thành hình bằng cuốn sách Mẹ dắt con đi.\nTên cuốn sách xuất phát từ câu ca dao về tình yêu vô bờ của mẹ, đã trở nên thân thuộc với mỗi người dân Việt: “Ví dầu cầu ván đóng đinh. Cầu tre lắt lẻo gập ghềnh khó đi. Khó đi mẹ dắt con đi. Con đi trường học, mẹ đi trường đời”. Vì lẽ đó, lật giở từng trang sách của Mẹ dắt con đi, bạn đọc sẽ gặp ở đây tấm lòng bao la của người mẹ trẻ với con mình. Người mẹ ấy không những mang nặng đẻ đau chín tháng mười ngày, mà còn tận tụy với con từ lúc con vừa được sinh ra, đến khi chập chững bước đi và bập bẹ cất lên những tiếng nói đầu tiên trong đời.\nTác giả Phoenix không kể một mạch những câu chuyện về Gấu - tên thân mật của con trai chị, từ lúc sinh ra cho đến lúc cậu bé được 7 tuổi; mà chị phân chia thành 6 nhóm truyện theo các chủ đề khác nhau như: Gắn bó, Thỏ thẻ như trẻ lên ba, Nuôi dưỡng tùy cá tính tự nhiên, Kỷ luật dựa trên giá trị sống, Khi con qua 5 tuổi và Những khoảng lặng. Những câu chuyện trong cuốn sách này, được viết một cách mộc mạc, tự nhiên giống như chị đang ghi lại những khoảnh khắc trong cuộc sống của hai mẹ con, từ trong nhà ra đường phố, từ chuyện ăn ngủ đến chuyện cư xử với những người xung quanh… Ở đó, có những câu chuyện khiến chúng ta không khỏi bật cười vì sự hồn nhiên, ngây thơ của Gấu; nhưng cũng có những câu chuyện khiến chúng ta phải bùi ngùi xúc động trước tình thương bao la mà chị dành cho con trai của mình.\nĐến với cuốn sách Mẹ dắt con đi của tác giả Phoenix, bạn đọc càng thêm tin rằng: không ai yêu thương ta bằng mẹ. Bạn đọc sẽ đồng cảm với cảm giác lần đầu tiên làm mẹ của Phonenix Ho khi chị có những thương lo không biết giãi bày cùng ai: “Cho dù làm mẹ tốt cách nào, lòng mẹ vẫn luôn canh cánh mình làm sai và sợ ảnh hưởng không tốt vào cuộc đời con sau này. Quá thông cảm ư? - Sau này con khó hài lòng với người khác. Quá cứng rắn ư? - Làm tổn thương con thì sao! Quá bảo vệ ư? - Rồi làm sao nó có thể tự lập khi trưởng thành”. Chị yêu con đến mức nhiều khi một biểu hiện gì đó khác thường ở con cũng khiến chị se thắt lòng, như khi phát hiện chiếc răng của con có một lỗ nhỏ, là dấu hiệu của sâu răng. Yêu con là vậy, nhưng Phoenix Ho cũng rất nghiêm khắc trong việc dạy dỗ con. Dù rất khó nhưng chị vẫn cố gắng để con trai mình hiểu rằng “yêu thương giữa cha mẹ và con cái phải có hai chiều”. Bởi theo chị, mục đích là để “tránh tình trạng con lớn lên khư khư trong tâm trí rằng cha mẹ thương mình là chuyện đương nhiên, còn ngược lại thì không hề có”.\nBạn đọc sẽ còn tìm thấy ở Mẹ dắt con đi những bài học và kinh nghiệm bổ ích trong việc dạy con, được tác giả Phoenix Ho chắt lọc từ rất nhiều tài liệu tin cậy cũng như từ trải nghiệm bản thân của lần đầu tiên làm mẹ. Đặc biệt là cách chị vượt qua khó khăn của giai đoạn làm mẹ đơn thân để yêu thương con, không để con phải thiếu thốn về tình cảm. Và giờ đây, khi đã vượt qua rất nhiều khó khăn của lần đầu làm mẹ, để chứng kiến con từng bước trưởng thành, chị cảm thấy rõ hơn về vai trò thiêng liêng của mình: “Đến ngày hôm nay tôi mới tự tin rằng mình sẽ làm tốt vai trò này. Tôi cảm thấy hãnh diện vì những gì mình đã đạt được và tôi tin mình sẽ còn tiếp tục học hỏi được thật nhiều mỗi ngày trong cuộc hành trình nuôi dạy con dài đằng đẵng này”.\n",

    "description": "Những gì xảy ra trong một đời người không nói gì về con người đó, mà là cách người đó lựa chọn ứng phó với những sự kiện trong đời mình\nTrình Tuấn sinh 1984, hiện là người cha đơn thân đang sống ở Tp. Hồ Chí Minh cùng cô con gái 2 tuổi tên Ủn. Vợ mất sau khi sinh con được 10 ngày, hiều được sự vô giá của sữa mẹ, suốt 2 năm, Trình Tuấn lặn lội đi xin sữa các mẹ cho con bú. Anh đã lập ra cộng đồng Ngân hàng sữa Mẹ để các mẹ chia sẻ nguồn sữa đến những em bé thiệt thòi, và là một trong những admind của cộng đồng Hội Sữa Mẹ để cổ vũ phong trào nuôi con bằng sữa mẹ.\n\"Ít ra cuộc đời đã không lấy đi của ba tất cả, ba vẫn còn Ủn để nhớ, để thương, để quay về nơi bình lặng sau cơn sóng dữ. Ủn là hạnh phúc của ba, là tất cả với ba bây giờ. Thật đáng sợ khi không còn gì bám víu trong dòng nước dữ, con người ta sẽ để mặc cho dòng đời cuốn đi. Ba sẽ thành kẻ đầu đường xó chợ, hay có thể là kẻ tâm thần ăn mày dĩ vãng, hay tệ hơn ai mà biết... Cảm ơn con đã níu ba lại để ba không gục ngã, để hôm nay nhận thấy tim mình còn thổn thức vì con...\"\nNhận định\n\"Một cuộc sống tốt đẹp có thực.\nCuốn tự truyện này được kể bằng giọng văn mộc mạc, chân tình, chậm rãi tưởng chừng như chỉ phù hợp với một tính cách nhẹ nhàng và đơn điệu nào đó, một cuộc sống nhẹ nhàng và thanh thản nào đó. Nhưng hóa ra theo từng lời kể chậm rãi ấy, người đọc bị hút vào một chuỗi sự kiện khó có thể tưởng nổi là chúng hội tụ trên chỉ riêng một con người, một chuỗi sự kiện dường như chưa có dấu hiệu dừng lại ngay cả khi cuốn sách đã khép, vẫn khiến người ta băn khoăn muốn biết điều gì kế tiếp sẽ xảy ra với chàng trai tài hoa nhưng nhiều lận đận của vùng đất Đô Lương này, với Ủn - cô con gái của anh với người vợ mà anh cho là có sứ mệnh đặc biệt đối với đời anh: đem Ủn đến cho anh và ra đi về cõi thiên đường chỉ 10 ngày sau khi Ủn ra đời.\nCuốn tự truyện là nhiều chuỗi cảm xúc đan xen, có lúc đầy ấp những ký ức thân thuộc về thiên nhiên êm đềm nơi miền quê hương Đô Lương tần tảo, có lúc dồn dập những hoạt động táy máy hay sáng tạo của một cậu bé quê nghèo nhưng nhiều ý tưởng và mơ mộng để rồi lớn lên trở thành một thành viên của đội tuyển sinh viên Việt Nam chiến thắng ở một cuộc thi tầm cỡ châu lục, đem lại cảm giác hãnh diện một thời cho những ai là người Việt, còn có hình ảnh một chàng sinh viên ham mê các hoạt động tình nguyện, dám dấn thân và trải nghiệm.\nCuốn tự truyện cũng nói về sự kiện đã khiến phần lớn chúng ta biết về anh, về sự trớ trêu của trò chơi nghiệt ngã mang tên Số phận. Những hiểu biết rời rạc qua nhiều mẩu báo giờ đây được người duy nhất còn lại trong cuộc xâu chuỗi lại bằng một nỗi niềm yêu thương da diết với người vợ “chịu đi mấy chục cây số trong đêm để đón anh”. Anh đã dằn vặt mình sau khi vợ mất. Nhưng sự kiện đau lòng đó dường như là chất xúc tác để anh đi tiếp những năm tháng chông gai bằng một sự kiên định mà chính anh cũng tự hỏi mình từ đâu mà có. Tuấn đã cho tôi một bài học về thực hiện trách nhiệm với quá khứ, với hiện tại và với tương lai - dù cuộc đời có ra sao đi nữa - hông qua cách anh quyết tâm muốn nuôi con bằng sữa mẹ, cách anh viết cho vợ anh, viết cho Ủn, dạy cho Ủn, cách anh lăn xả trên khắp các nẻo đường cả nước và trong đam mê của cá nhân anh. Của cải anh để dành cho Ủn là thứ Ủn sẽ không bao giờ mất - đó là thái độ với cuộc sống đầy trách nhiệm, không yếu mềm, không bỏ cuộc và biết tri ân những người quen và không quen.\nGần như cùng lúc với khi tôi đọc cuốn tự truyện này, ở Châu Âu, một viên phi công của hãng hàng không German Wings đã kết liễu đời mình và hơn trăm sinh mạng vô tội, chỉ vì anh ta trầm cảm và muốn người ta nhớ đến mình bằng bất cứ giá nào. Thật là đáng hổ thẹn khi nghĩ rằng ai đó có lý do chính đáng để tự giết mình và giết bao nhiêu sinh mạng khác. Đối với tôi, tự truyện của Tuấn còn đem lại cho tôi bằng chứng về một cuộc sống tốt đẹp có thực, nơi nhiều người biết chia sẻ lòng từ ái cho những mảnh đời chưa kịp may mắn như mình, như con mình. Như sen thơm mọc ở giữa bùn lầy, lòng từ ái của họ, của Tuấn, của hàng ngàn bà mẹ khác có sức mạnh lan tỏa và khích lệ mãnh liệt. Như Ủn không chỉ có một mẹ, Mẹ của Ủn là rất nhiều bà mẹ mà Tuấn biết tên cũng như không biết tên. Mẹ của Ủn là hiện thân của tình thương không vụ lợi, là sự lo lắng cho sự an toàn của nhiều sinh linh bé bỏng xa lạ. Chỉ cần sinh linh đó cần đến, lòng từ ái kia hiện diện. Nếu Con cần, Mẹ có.\nCầu chúc cho đoạn đường sắp đến của Cụ Mết và bé Ủn sẽ được người Mẹ trên thiên đường kia soi bước và tiếp sức. Cầu chúc một kết cục có hậu đến với mọi mảnh đời đã nhiều vất vả gian truân.\nMong rằng cuốn tự truyện này sẽ được đón nhận và yêu mến bởi các độc giả.\"\n(Đỗ Quốc Hiệp - Nguyên Phó chủ tịch Qũy đầu tư IDG Ventures Vietnam)\n",

    "description": "Trong cuộc sống, chúng ta thường nghe thấy các bậc phụ huynh phàn nàn: “Con tôi rất nhút nhát, hay xấu hổ, không hay nói chuyện, khách đến nhà là chạy đi mất”. “Con tôi nhát lắm, làm việc gì cũng rụt rè, chẳng giống nam tử hán chút nào”. “Con tôi rất sợ khó khăn, chưa thử làm đã bỏ cuộc rồi”. “Con tôi gặp phải chuyện nhỏ đã lúng túng, không biết làm thế nào, chỉ khóc là giỏi thôi”. “Con tôi chẳng ra làm sao cả, lúc nào cũng lủi thủi một mình khiến tôi lo lắm…”. Những vấn đề như vậy khiến các bậc cha mẹ vô cùng lo lắng. Tóm lại, những tình trạng kể trên đều có liên quan đến tính cách nhút nhát của trẻ.\nVì nhút nhát, các em không dám phát biểu ý kiến trước chỗ đông người, khi gặp người lạ hoặc ở trong môi trường xa lạ, các em thường tỏ ra xấu hổ, ngại ngùng, lo lắng, không thể giao tiếp với mọi người một cách thoải mái, cởi mở. Trong cuộc sống và học tập, các em luôn thiếu tính chủ động, dũng khí và sự tự tin, nên đã để lỡ nhiều cơ hội và thành công vốn thuộc về chúng. Vì vậy, nhút nhát là hòn đá cản đường trưởng thành và thành công của trẻ.\nVậy tại sao trẻ lại có tính cách nhút nhát? Làm thế nào giúp trẻ tính cách nhút nhát, yếu đuối trở nên dũng cảm và đạt được thành công trong xã hội là vấn đề được rất nhiều bậc cha mẹ quan tâm.\nChuyên gia tâm lí phân tích và chỉ ra rằng, trẻ nhút nhát, ngoài ảnh hưởng bởi khả năng thiên bẩm, cách giáo dục sau này cũng là nguyên nhân quan trọng. Hiện nay đa số trẻ em đều là con một, thiếu sự giao tiếp với những đứa trẻ khác, cha mẹ lại quá nuông chiều, khiến trẻ khó thích nghi với hoàn cảnh, khi đối diện với người lạ hoặc môi trường lạ, trẻ dễ xuất hiện tâm lí sợ hãi. Có bậc cha mẹ còn quá nghiêm khắc, khiến cả ngày trẻ sống trong cảm giác sợ hãi, không dám thử việc mới, dần dần trở thành nhút nhát.\nTrẻ nhút nhát, có ảnh hưởng bất lợi đến sự phát triển toàn diện về thể chất và tâm hồn. Vì thế, cha mẹ cần coi trọng, quan tâm đến vấn đề này. Chỉ khi nào cha mẹ nắm bắt được lí luận giáo dục khoa học, có phương pháp giáo dục thích hợp, kiên trì hướng dẫn, trẻ mới trở nên dũng cảm, tự tin và hoạt bát.\nĐối với trẻ nhút nhát, bố mẹ không nên nôn nóng, sốt ruột. Không thể trách móc trẻ, hoặc hi vọng một cách ảo tưởng rằng một ngày nào đó chúng sẽ trở nên dũng cảm, hoạt bát, nhanh nhẹn. Cần biết phát hiện ưu điểm của trẻ, tích cực động viên và cổ vũ để trẻ dần dần mạnh dạn hơn. Đối với trẻ, môi trường gia đình vô cùng quan trọng. Môi trường gia đình bình đẳng, hiểu biết, ấm áp sẽ giúp cho trẻ tràn đầy tự tin và dũng cảm, khắc phục tính nhút nhát. Vì thế, trước mặt trẻ, cha mẹ không nên dùng quyền uy, càng không nên nói những lời gây tổn thương đến lòng tự trọng của trẻ. Ngoài ra, giao tiếp với mọi người có thể bồi dưỡng sự mạnh dạn cho trẻ. Vì thế, cha mẹ cần tạo nhiều cơ hội cho trẻ tiếp xúc với thế giới bên ngoài, để trẻ giao lưu với nhiều bạn, trong quá trình giao tiếp đó, trẻ có sự tự tin, tăng khả năng nói chuyện và khắc phục tâm lí nhút nhát.\nĐể giúp các bậc cha mẹ có phương pháp giáo dục hiệu quả và có lí luận giáo dục khoa học, xuất phát từ tình hình thực tế giáo dục ở các gia đình, cũng như kết hợp các kinh nghiệm của các bậc cha mẹ dạy dỗ con cái thành công và tư tưởng giáo dục của các chuyên gia nước ngoài, cuốn sách đã biên tập chi tiết từ việc thay đổi thái độ giáo dục của cha mẹ, nâng cao sự tự tin, tăng khả năng giao tiếp, làm phong phú kinh nghiệm sống, rèn luyện ý chí kiên cường cho trẻ, còn giúp cha mẹ có những gợi ý sâu sắc trong việc dạy dỗ con cái.\nCác ví dụ trong cuốn sách đều điển hình, lí luận sâu sắc, dễ hiểu, phương pháp đơn giản, thực dụng, có tính ứng dụng thực tế cao. Cuốn sách giúp cha mẹ có phương pháp dạy con dũng cảm, dũng cảm đối diện với cuộc sống hàng ngày, dũng cảm giao tiếp với bạn bè, đối mặt với khó khăn, đối diện với hành vi của mình và phát triển lành mạnh.\n",

    "description": "ĐÁNH GIÁ TỪ TIKI.VN\nNgười Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt đã đặt ra vẫn đề muôn thuở với các vị phụ huynh, đó là giáo dục con cái. Là một trong số ít những cuốn sách được đánh giá cao về giáo dục gia đình, Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt gồm bảy chương với các chủ đề khác nhau, theo trẻ trừ khi còn nhỏ cho đến lúc trưởng thành.\nNgười Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt đưa ra nhiều quan điểm mà các bậc cha mẹ phải lưu ý khi dạy trẻ bởi có thể đối với người lớn, đó là vấn đề rất nhỏ nhặt nhưng với con trẻ lại là chuyện lớn. Cuốn sách phân tích và nhận xét toàn diện quanh việc giáo dục con cái như điểm số, học hành, giải trí, khen, phạt,... Những kinh nghiệm trong sách được tác giả đúc rút bằng chính trải nghiệm của bản thân mình qua việc dạy dỗ con cái.\nNgười Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt đánh giá rất cao vai trò của giáo dục gia đình trong việc định hình nhân cách những đứa trẻ. Và tất nhiên, không thể thiếu trong mọi phương pháp dạy trẻ, Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt có nền tảng bằng tình yêu thương của người mẹ dành cho con.\n©\nCuốn sách Người mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt là một cuốn sổ tay về cách nuôi dạy con của nhà giáo, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi. Chị đã tổng kết kinh nghiệm gần hai mươi năm nuôi dạy con, đồng thời kết hợp với một nền tảng lí thuyết vững chắc và kinh nghiệm thực tế có được trong quá trình trực tiếp dạy học cũng như tiếp xúc với khá nhiều trẻ em, từ đó đúc rút ra được những bài học quý báu trong cuốn sách này.\nNgười mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt đề cập đến rất nhiều vấn đề lớn nhỏ trong quá trình nuôi dạy con cái, nhưng tựu chung lại có thể gói gọn  thành hai vế: đó là nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn và trí tuệ của con trẻ. Tác giả không viết về những thứ quá vĩ mô và trừu tượng mà ngược lại, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn và trí tuệ của trẻ từ những điều đơn giản nhất, như chính tác giả đã viết “Với trẻ em không có chuyện nhỏ, mọi chuyện nhỏ đối với trẻ đều là chuyện lớn”.\nCuốn sách được trình bày dưới dạng những bài viết nhỏ, mỗi bài viết đề cập đến một vấn đề trong quá trình nuôi dạy con cái mà hầu hết các bậc phụ huynh đều gặp phải như làm thế nào để trẻ không sợ tiêm, trả lời thế nào khi trẻ hỏi em bé từ đâu đến, làm thế nào khi con trẻ nói dối, tạo lập những phẩm chất tính cách tốt đẹp cho con trẻ… đến những vấn đề trong học tập như dạy con biết chữ, làm toán, viết văn… Những bài viết này rất chân thực, gần gũi, dễ hiểu, không đi vào lối mòn sáo rỗng và nặng về lí thuyết, rất dễ dàng cho các bậc phụ huynh đọc và ứng dụng.\nNgoài ra, trong cuốn sách này, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi cũng đề cập đến một số vấn đề bất cập trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc và các đối sách cần có của các bậc phụ huynh. Hệ thống giáo dục của Việt Nam có nhiều điểm tương đồng với hệ thống giáo dục của Trung Quốc, vì vậy bạn đọc cũng có thể tham khảo và tự tìm ra cho mình những cách giải quyết riêng.\nTác giả cuốn sách là một nhà giáo, một chuyên gia giáo dục có nhiều năm làm công tác giảng dạy, tư vấn và nghiên cứu giáo dục gia đình, nhưng trên hết chị còn là một người mẹ. Vì vậy, trong cuốn sách này, ngoài những quan niệm giáo dục độc đáo đầy trí tuệ, người đọc còn có thể bắt gặp tình yêu con sâu sắc ngập tràn trong từng trang viết của chị. Tác giả quan niệm: Các bậc phụ huynh cần đứng trên góc độ của con trẻ để nhìn nhận vấn đề, đừng bắt ép con trẻ sống theo lối sống mà người lớn áp đặt cho chúng. Bởi vì “trẻ em là một thế giới tồn tại độc lập hoàn mỹ, trong cơ thể bé nhỏ của chúng ẩn chứa sức sống mạnh mẽ vô biên, trong quá trình trưởng thành chúng có một tiềm lực biểu đạt tự mình nhào nặn, tự mình thành hình, giống như bên trong một hạt giống có ẩn chứa rễ, lá, hoa, trong điều kiện thích hợp tự nhiên sẽ phát triển (Trích “Người mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt”). Đây thực sự là một quan niệm giáo dục độc đáo và đầy tiến bộ, rất đáng cho chúng ta nghiên cứu và học hỏi.\nCuốn sách phù hợp cho những người làm công tác giáo dục, quan tâm đến giáo dục và những người sắp làm cha, làm mẹ cũng như các bậc phụ huynh có con ở độ tuổi thiếu nhi đến độ tuổi mười bảy, mười tám.\n",

    "description": "Trong thế kỷ 21, một yêu cầu cấp bách được đặt ra với lực lượng lao động trẻ đó là cần có các kỹ năng cần thiết để hòa nhập và đáp ứng được cho công việc vốn ngày một đòi hỏi cao. Các nhà doanh nghiệp trên thế giới có chung nhận định rằng lao động trẻ ngày nay thiếu kỹ năng trầm trọng. Một người lao động của thế kỷ 21 cần sở hữu tính sáng tạo cao, kỹ năng phân tích nhạy bén, có tầm nhìn xa và - điều ngạc nhiên hơn là họ có kỹ năng sống tốt. Những điều đó hầu như chưa được đào tạo bài bản trong nhà trường - nơi lâu nay vẫn tâp trung chính vào việc đào tạo học sinh những kiến thức học thuật.\nĐiều này đã khiến nhiều nhà giáo tâm huyết day dứt, họ muốn áp dụng một chương trình dạy về kỹ năng lãnh đạo cho trẻ em, dựa trên các kỹ năng sống cần thiết từ 7 thói quen để thành đạt - cuốn sách về kỹ năng bán chạy hàng đầu thế giới của tiến sĩ Stephen R. Covey.\nNhà lãnh đạo trong tôi chính là câu chuyện về những nhà giáo tâm huyết đã xây dựng nên chương trình kỹ năng lãnh đạo cho học sinh từ mẫu giáo tới trung học. Trong cuốn sách này, chính tác giả của 7 thói quen để thành đạt, nhà giáo dục và đồng thời là chuyên gia nổi tiếng về lĩnh vực lãnh đạo - tiến sĩ Stephen R. Covey sẽ kể cho bạn nghe về xuất phát điểm của chương trình và lí do tại sao nó trở thành làn sóng lan tỏa trên toàn cầu.\n- Tại Raleigh, North Carolina, trường tiểu học A.B. Combs được biết tới như là trường chuyên số một tại Mỹ sau khi tiến hành những cải thiện đáng kể và duy trì thành tích học tập được nâng cao của học sinh.\n- Tại Alberta, Canada, báo cáo từ trường tiểu học Joseph Welsh cho thấy rằng sự hài lòng của các bậc phụ huynh với những gì mà con họ đang được học đã tăng vọt từ 67% lên 98%.\n- Tại Decatur, Alabama, một giám đốc điều hành tại địa phương đã quyết định tài trợ cho trường tiểu học Chestnut Grove để giảng dạy chương trình kỹ năng lãnh đạo.\n- Tại Nhật Bản, các ông bố bà mẹ đang chi trả rất nhiều tiền cho hơn 15.000 thiếu niên tham gia vào những chương trình ngoại khóa, nơi các em được dạy về các nguyên tắc lãnh đạo cơ bản.\n- Tại Adams County, Illinois, United Way đã ghi nhận thành công trong việc cải cách giảng dạy tại trường tiểu học Dewey và đã tài trợ để đảm bảo đem tới cho hơn 10.000 học sinh tại học khu cơ hội học tập tương tự.\n- Tại thành phố Chicago, Illinois, hệ thống trường tư thục Noble đã và đang phát triển nhanh chóng với việc có đến 7 trường trung học và hiện đang có điểm ACT trung bình (American College Testing - Kiểm tra đầu vào đại học) cao hơn bất kỳ trường công lập nào ở Chicago.\n- Tại Guatemala, chính phủ có một tầm nhìn xa trong việc truyền cảm hứng cho thanh thiếu niên tại các trường trung học, thông qua việc giảng dạy những nguyên tắc sẽ giúp các em thoát khỏi vòng luẩn quẩn của đói nghèo cũng như mở ra hi vọng mới cho đất nước trong tương lai.\nCuốn sách có những lời khuyên, chỉ dẫn dành cho các nhà giáo, những nhà lãnh đạo giáo dục mong muốn áp dụng kỹ năng lãnh đạo cho học sinh của họ. Sách cũng có một phần hướng dẫn cho việc triển khai chương trình lãnh đạo bản thân tại mỗi gia đình, điều này có thể giúp các phụ huynh dạy con mình các kỹ năng lãnh đạo tại nhà trong trường hợp trẻ không có điều kiện tiếp cận chương trình tại trường.\nCuốn sách này sẽ là nguồn cảm hứng cho các nhà giáo, các bậc phụ huynh trong việc dạy các kỹ năng lãnh đạo cho trẻ, để các em lãnh đạo bản thân mình tốt nhất có thể, trở thành những công dân tốt, có trách nhiệm và đáp ứng được các yêu cầu khắt khe của thị trường lao động thế kỷ 21.\n",

    "description": "Tôi bắt đầu viết cuốn sách The Toddler’s Busy Book khi bé út Johanna bắt đầu bước vào giai đoạn tập đi. Bé tập đi từng bước rồi biết chạy chỉ vài tháng trước khi đến sinh nhật đầu tiên, và kể từ lúc đó bé đi không ngừng! Sau ba lần trải qua những thách thức trong giai đoạn nuôi trẻ sơ sinh/ trẻ tập đi/ trẻ mẫu giáo với các anh chị lớn của Johanna, tôi chợt quên nỗi gian nan khi nuôi dạy một em bé mới biết đi, nhất là một em bé cực kì hiếu động! Nhưng tôi cũng vô cùng sung sướng khi thấy bé lớn lên theo từng giai đoạn của những tháng ngày chậm chững tập đi rồi biết đi vững. Trước khi biết bò và biết đi, bé chỉ biết ngồi một chỗ nơi bé được đặt. Thế mà giờ đây, chỉ vài tháng sau đó, bé hồ hởi đi khám phá xung quanh ngôi nhà. Thật vui biết bao khi thấy bé quấy rầy anh chị lớn, bắt chước ba mẹ, hay khi bé bắt đầu với các trò chơi giả vờ, ví dụ như khi bé vỗ bé “em bé”, hay khi tôi nhận thấy nét mặt đầy xúc cảm của bé khi bé thấy người khác khóc, hay khi bé thể hiện sự biết chia sẻ bằng cách cho chú mèo nhỏ ăn một chút bánh của mình!\nGiai đoạn bé tập đi là giai đoạn tuyệt vời trong cuộc đời trẻ và cha mẹ, và bạn sẽ thích thú hơn nữa với giai đoạn này nếu bạn chuẩn bị tinh thần để giảm chậm nhịp sống hơn một chút; hãy ngồi trên sàn nhà nhiều hơn và chỉ dọn dẹp đồ chơi của con vào buổi tối, khi con đã đi ngủ. Hãy sắp xếp không gian trong nhà thành khu vui chơi an toàn, lý thú cho con khám phá. Hãy thường xuyên cho con làm quen với những con người mới, địa điểm mới, trải nghiệm mới. Hãy nâng cao tinh thần phiêu lưu và nhìn thế giới xung quanh qua đôi mắt của con, vì con đang bắt đầu khám phá ra những điều kì diệu của thế giới này.The Toddler’s busy book sẽ giúp bạn tận hưởng niềm vui của những năm đầu đời bé tập đi và biết đi. Cuốn sách sẽ giúp bạn khơi dậy sự hào hứng của trẻ bằng những ý tưởng đơn giản, thú vị mà ngay cả những ông bố bà mẹ bận rộn nhất, hay những bảo mẫu chăm sóc trẻ, đều có thể thực hiện được. Cuốn sách bao gồm các gợi ý dành cho nhiều tình huống: hoạt động trong nhà hay ngoài trời, dù hè hay đông, vào những lúc yên tĩnh hay bận rộn.\nTôi viết cuốn sách này dành tặng các cha mẹ ở nhà trông con, nhưng cuốn sách cũng rất hợp với những ai có một em bé mới biết đi trong nhà: các bà mẹ, các ông bố, ông bà, dì, cậu, chú, người trông trẻ, giáo viên mầm non, các tu sĩ hoặc người chủ trò của nhóm trẻ mẫu giáo. Nếu bạn dành chút thời gian nào đó cho một đứa trẻ mới biết đi, vậy thì cuốn sách này dành cho bạn đấy! Mặc dù rất nhiều trong số các ý tưởng trong cuốn sách The Toddler’s busy book có thể sẽ khiến trẻ thích thú sau giai đoạn mới biết đi, nhưng các hoạt động này phù hợp nhất cho trẻ từ một đến ba tuổi. Do khả năng của các trẻ ở độ tuổi này có nhiều khác biệt nên một số ý tưởng hoạt động có vẻ quá mức so với trẻ một tuổi, trong khi một số ý tưởng khác lại quá dễ so với trẻ ba tuổi. Hãy vận dụng khả năng đánh giá để lựa chọn hoạt động phù hợp nhất với khả năng và sở thích của con. Bạn không nên từ bỏ ngay nếu một số hoạt động chưa đem lại hiệu quả như mong đợi; hãy thử lại các hoạt động đó vào tuần sau, tháng sau hoặc năm sau, hoặc thay đổi hoạt động sao cho hoạt động đó tạo nhiều ý nghĩa và thú vị hơn cho con.\nTôi thực sự thích thú khi được trải nghiệm lại giai đoạn tập đi của con thêm lần nữa khi đứa con đầu lòng đã bước vào độ tuổi thanh niên. Kinh nghiệm nuôi ba đứa con đã giúp tôi trân trọng sự ngắn ngủi của những năm thơ ấu đầu đời - tôi đã không có được sự trân trọng đó cách đây mười năm, khi đứa con đầu lòng hãy là một đứa trẻ mới biết đi. Mặc dù hồi đó, dường như đám trẻ nhà tôi không chịu lớn, nhưng thực ra tất cả chúng đều lớn lên từng ngày, và con bạn cũng vậy. Rồi sẽ đến lúc tã và bỉm chỉ là chuyện của ngày hôm qua; nào bình sữa, núm vú cao su, chậu tắm phủ kín đồ chơi, những giấc ngủ ngắn buổi chiều, những ngón tay dính bẩn… và rất nhiều những dấu ấn riêng trong giai đoạn bé tập đi sẽ trở thành chuyện quá khứ mà thôi. Mỗi giai đoạn trong thời thơ ấu của trẻ đều đem lại những thách thức và niềm vui đặc biệt. Sẽ có những ngày bạn sung sướng hơn hẳn, nhưng sẽ có những ngày bạn sẽ chỉ mong mau mau hết ngày. Mô hình này không thay đổi đâu nhé, bất kể con bạn bao nhiêu tuổi đi nữa!\nTôi hi vọng bạn sẽ yêu thương con vô điều kiện, biết cách vận dụng khiếu hài hước và tận hưởng những năm bé mới biết đi - vì giống như dấu tay của con trên tường- tháng ngày đó sẽ trôi qua trước khi bạn kịp nhận thấy đấy.\n",

Cuốn sách chia sẻ với các bậc cha mẹ \"Làm thế nào để yêu con đúng cách\", \"Thế nào là yêu con theo từng giai đoạn\", \"Người mẹ có ảnh hưởng như thế nào đối với sự trưởng thành của con trẻ\"...\nCon cái là món quà quý nhất của cha mẹ. Nuôi dạy con vốn là một việc vô cùng vui vẻ hạnh phúc, nhưng vì sao ngày càng có nhiều bậc phụ huynh cảm thấy đây là trách nhiệm nặng nề? Vì con không nghe lời, không thích học, thành tích học không tốt, lên lớp không như ý muốn, khiến bao bậc phụ huynh hao tổn tinh thần. Đối mặt với vô vàn mối băn khoăn mà các bà mẹ gặp phải khi giáo dục con, Đại sư Ven. Pomnyun Sunim đã đem đến cho người đọc những ý kiến và nguyên tắc giáo dục gia đình hoàn toàn mới mẻ, những thao tác kĩ năng đơn giản mà thiết thực, chỉ ra một con đường rộng mở trong việc giáo dục con bằng nhân tâm.

    "description": "Bất cứ một bậc cha mẹ nào cũng đều cảm thấy vui mừng khi biết rằng con mình là một đứa trẻ có “tiềm năng”. Đó có thể là tiềm năng trong học tập, trong thể thao hay trong một lĩnh vực xã hội khác và bạn có thể hình dung ra những thành tích mà con đạt được trong tương lai, thậm chí vượt qua tất thảy mọi khó khăn bạn từng nếm trải. Nhưng tiềm năng cũng là một từ được xét vào “trạng thái nguy hiểm”.\nTiềm năng trở thành một gánh nặng khi các bậc cha mẹ xem nó như một khuynh hướng định trước dẫn đến những thành tích ấn tượng. Tệ hơn nữa, thành tích có thể trở thành động lực duy nhất để đứa trẻ tập trung phấn đấu và rèn luyện, thay vì phát triển những giá trị quan trọng khác.\nCuốn sách Phương pháp khôn ngoan để nuôi dạy con thông minh của tác giả Eileen Kennedy-Moore và Mark S.Lowenthal giúp các bậc cha mẹ thông thái nuôi dưỡng tiềm năng của trẻ, tạo ra một cuộc sống ý nghĩa và ấm áp cũng như đồng hành cùng con vượt qua áp lực và khủng hoảng.\nXã hội hiện đại khiến trẻ em phải đối mặt với những thách thức và áp lực về thành tích, vấn đề này càng trầm trọng hơn đối với một đứa trẻ có “tiềm năng”. Tác giả Eileen Kennedy-Moore và Mark S.Lowenthal đã quan sát những thực nghiệm tâm lý của trẻ em và phát hiện ra rằng những đứa trẻ thông minh lại thường là những đứa trẻ hay sợ hãi, dễ bỏ cuộc và chịu những bất hạnh từ chính sự kỳ vọng của gia đình và xã hội. Trên thực tế, một vài đứa trẻ trong số những đứa trẻ hay giận dữ, thường cảm thấy căng thẳng và không có một cuộc sống hạnh phúc giữa sự bao bọc lại là những đứa trẻ có nền tảng tư duy tốt nhất.\nCuốn sách này gửi những thông điệp rõ ràng và thoải mái cho các bậc cha mẹ đang quan tâm đến việc phát triển nội lực của con cũng như mong muốn đảm bảo con mình phát triển hoàn toàn ổn định và thành công.\n",

    "description": "Một trong những sai lầm cơ bản nhất của các bà mẹ hiện đại là chiều chuộng con quá mức, làm thay con cả những việc đáng ra chúng phải tự làm. Họ cho rằng đó là biểu hiện của tình yêu thương, và hy vọng đứa con hiểu được ý nghĩa của chúng. Và một ngày kia, bà mẹ thức giấc, đau khổ xen lẫn hối hận khi nhận ra con cái trưởng thành một cách ích kỷ, lười biếng, ỉ lại và vô dụng.\nMerrilee Browne Boyack khuyên bạn hãy rũ bỏ hết những mặc cảm tội lỗi trong quá khứ, chỉ tập trung vào hiện tại và tương lai. Con bạn cần lớn lên và trường thành, vì vậy tính độc lập là điều quan trọng hàng đầu bạn cần dạy cho trẻ. Cuốn sách Bước đột phá trong việc nuôi dạy con không giúp bạn xử lý các vấn đề về kỷ luật và hành vi, đây là một “kế hoạch nuôi dưỡng tính độc lập cho trẻ”, con bạn cần lớn lên, cần phải biết tự chăm sóc cho cuộc sống và tương lai của mình, vì vậy, bạn cần phải đọc cuốn sách này và nghe lời khuyên của Merrilee Browne Boyack.\n",

    "description": "Trả lời câu hỏi của nhiều người thắc mắc vì sao lại viết cuốn sách Dạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của cái đầu gối bị trầy xước, tác giả trả lời:\n“Tôi viết sách để nhắc nhở bản thân mình làm theo những gì được viết trong đó. Và điều này gần như luôn có tác dụng. Bằng cách sử dụng những bài học của đạo Do Thái do chính mình nhắc đến trong cuốn sách, tôi đã không còn bao bọc thái quá, luôn lên sẵn lịch trình, nuông chiều và đặt những kỳ vọng cao ngút trời vào con cái  những thứ vốn là chuẩn mực của vùng Los Angeles, nơi tôi nuôi dạy hai cô con gái nhỏ của mình. Tôi rất rõ ràng và có chiến lược trong việc dạy bọn trẻ biết kính trọng cha mẹ, tôi cũng cố gắng tôn trọng các con bằng cách trân trọng cả tài năng lẫn khuyết điểm của chúng. Ngày nào tôi cũng nhắc bản thân mình nhớ đến câu nói trong đạo Do Thái rằng mọi bậc cha mẹ đều phải dạy con mình học bơi - tôi đã áp dụng triết lý này bằng cách để các con gái mình leo lên những thân cây thật cao, dùng những con dao sắc nhọn, nấu ăn với chiếc chảo nóng và tất nhiên, vì tôi sống ở Nam California, dạy chúng bơi, nhảy từ trên cao và lặn xuống những vùng nước sâu ngay từ khi chúng còn rất nhỏ.\nKhi tôi phát hành cuốn sách đầu tiên, các con tôi mới 9 và 13 tuổi. Tôi đã hoàn toàn tự tin khi nghĩ đến quãng thời gian chúng bắt đầu trưởng thành. Khi các con gái tôi bước vào tuổi mới lớn, tôi đã là một chuyên gia. Thật thế. Tôi là một nhà tâm lý học xã hội, có nghĩa rằng tôi được đào tạo bài bản để nhìn nhận các vấn đề liên quan đến cảm xúc trong từng bối cảnh văn hóa cụ thể. Chuyên ngành của tôi là nuôi dạy con cái và sự phát triển bình thường của trẻ. Tôi đã làm việc với các gia đình trong suốt 30 năm liền. Tôi hiểu về các học thuyết liên quan đến vấn đề cá tính hóa, tác động của tuổi dậy thì đến tính cách, nhịp điệu sinh lý hàng ngày phá vỡ giấc ngủ như thế nào và khao khát phiêu lưu mạo hiểm ở tuổi mới lớn.\nTôi cũng ý thức rất rõ về tác động của nền văn hóa vận động nhanh chóng, đầy cạnh tranh, thô bạo cùng sự phát triển của công nghệ Internet đến việc phát triển một nhân cách tốt ở giới trẻ. Tôi đồng thời rất chú ý đến việc trẻ mới lớn rất dễ bị tổn thương bởi sự lo lắng, thói quen ăn uống bừa bãi, tình trạng tự làm bản thân bị thương, sự thất vọng, các vấn đề liên quan đến học tập, sự chú ý cũng như việc lạm dụng thuốc. Tôi hình dung rằng với hàng tá những bí quyết liên quan đến chuyên môn cũng như tôn giáo, tôi sẽ dẫn các con gái mình vượt qua tất cả những mối nguy hiểm thường thấy của tuổi mới lớn. Và khi bước qua ngưỡng tuổi đó, các con gái tôi sẽ trở thành những con người có trách nhiệm, trưởng thành và là những thành viên gia đình tốt hơn. Dưới sự hướng dẫn chín chắn của tôi, chúng tôi sẽ có những mối quan tâm chung và những cuộc trò chuyện sâu sắc hơn. Vòng quay cuộc sống thường nhật của gia đình tôi cũng sẽ trơn tru hơn khi giờ đây các thành viên trong gia đình đã cao lớn, thông minh, ăn rơ với nhau và sáng tạo hơn.\"\nXin giới thiệu với bạn đọc Combo Dạy Con Kiểu Do Thái gồm 2 quyển:\nDạy Con Kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của cái đầu gối bị trầy xước\nDạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ\n",

    "description": "Có thể bạn không thấy cái tên Dave Engledow quen thuộc, nhưng chắc chắn bạn đã nhìn thấy những bức ảnh của anh trong thời gian qua - những bức ảnh đã tạo nên một “cơn sốt” trên internet, với hàng triệu lượt quan tâm. Những hình ảnh đó đã được Nhà xuất bản Penguin Group (Mỹ) biên soạn thành cuốn sách ảnh Confession of the World’s Best Father, ra mắt độc giả vào tháng 5 năm 2014.\nCuốn sách được tác giả viết tặng vợ và con gái Jen và Alice Bee, trong nhiều năm, nhiếp ảnh gia người Washington D.C, Dave Engledow đã liên tục sáng tạo ra những bức ảnh hài hước với tên gọi World’s Best Father. Nội dung các bức hình \"vẽ lại\" hình ảnh một ông bố có khi luộm thuộm, hay quên và thiếu kỹ năng chăm sóc cô con gái nhỏ Alice Bee, khắc họa hình ảnh ông bố bất cẩn và cô con gái nhỏ luôn bị đặt trong những tình huống hết sức thiếu an toàn, khiến bạn đọc thấy đó là những tình huống nguy hiểm…. Tưởng như đó là những hình ảnh rất thật đã xảy ra trong lúc chăm con gái, nhưng thực chất đó chỉ là những shoot hình của những tình huống vui giả tưởng, không phải là \"hoàn cảnh\" thật của Dave. Dave tâm sự rằng: Ý định ban đầu của ông khi sáng tạo ra loạt ảnh này là chỉ muốn ghi lại những phút giây đẹp nhất của con gái một cách thật độc đáo. Khi Alice mới được 9 tuần tuổi, ông quyết định sẽ chụp một bức ảnh để làm sao thể hiện được sự mệt mỏi và thiếu ngủ trầm trọng của chính ông, trong vai trò một người lần đầu làm cha, vì thế, ông chụp một bức trong lúc đang bế Alice và lấy sữa của em bé để pha cà phê cho mình. Ông đăng bức ảnh này lên mạng, rồi bạn bè và gia đình khen rất nhiều, thế nên ông quyết định chụp nhiều hơn, chia sẻ nhiều hơn với mọi người giai đoạn làm cha đáng nhớ của mình..\nNếu để ý kỹ bạn sẽ thấy trong mỗi bức ảnh đều xuất hiện một \"đạo cụ\" quen thuộc là chiếc cốc có in dòng chữ World's Best Father yêu thích của ông bố Engledow.Trong một bài phỏng vấn, Dave Engledow đã nói:  Đã có rất nhiều cuốn sách và blog nói về chuyện làm cha mẹ, nhưng chúng đều đề cập việc này một cách khá nghiêm túc. Tôi không muốn nói giảm đi trách nhiệm của mình, nhưng tôi nghĩ: có một điều quan trọng không kém, mà các bậc phụ huynh cũng phải nhận ra, rằng không phải lúc nào chúng ta cũng có câu trả lời cho tất cả. Tạo ra những niềm vui khi có em bé là cự kỳ cần thiết.”\nTriết lý cơ bản của tác giả là làm sao để đảm bảo rằng “cha đang cùng con tận hưởng thời thơ ấu với nhau một cách trọn vẹn, làm sao để dành nhiều thời gian nhất với con, làm sao để cho con thấy, một cách thường xuyên nhất, rằng con đang được yêu thương rất nhiều\". Như một món quà và mong muốn mỗi người cha đều khao khát được trở thành người cha tốt nhất trong mắt những đứa con của mình. Mỗi ngày trôi qua đều đầy những thử thách, nhưng cũng mang lại những điều mới mẻ và kỳ diệu. Được làm bố là điều tuyệt vời nhất mà người đàn ông nào cũng muốn trải qua. Có lẽ đó là tất cả những gì mà những người cha trên thế gian này có thể mong đợi.\nTrích đoạn\n… “Ôi trời. Cuối cùng thì sáng nay Jen cũng đã phát giác chuyện gì xảy ra với những bình sữa đặc biệt mà cô ấy để trong tủ lạnh cho Alice Bee. Trong sáu tháng qua, dù đã cố gắng rất nhiều để đổi lại về kem thường, nhưng có vẻ như tôi không thể làm được. Sáng nay, chuyện lên đến đỉnh điểm khi Jen phát hiện ra trong tủ lạnh không còn tí sữa nào cho Alice Bee. Tôi lập tức xung phong ra cửa hàng mua thêm một ít (hy vọng cuối cùng cô ấy sẽ tiết lộ chỗ mua) nhưng không có tí may mắn nào. Cô ấy lẩm bẩm điều gì đó kiểu như “Anh thực sự không biết em đầu tư bao nhiêu thời gian và nỗ lực để Alice Bee có được chế độ dinh dưỡng tốt nhất đúng không?” và biến đi mất. Nghiêm túc ra thì rót sữa vào bình cho trẻ khó đến mức nào được chứ? Nhưng rồi, đêm đó, tôi lại khám phá ra vì sao vợ mình lại là người tuyệt vời nhất mà tôi biết. Khi tôi mở tủ lạnh ra để lấy cho Alice Bee một trong những bình sữa đặc biệt của con bé, tôi phát hiện ra rằng Jen đã chu đáo trữ thêm trong giá vài bình đặc biệt nữa dành cho tôi.\n",

    "description": "Bạn có thể tiếc nuối nhiều về tuổi thơ của mình nhưng đừng bao giờ cho con mình một tuổi thơ đầy hối tiếc. Những đứa trẻ tuy bình thường nhưng chỉ cần được giáo dục đúng cách sẽ có thể trở thành thiên tài!\nThái Tiếu Vãn là một minh chứng điển hình cho việc áp dụng phương pháp giáo dục con như thế. Quan điểm của người cha bình thường ấy rất đỗi giản dị: Làm cha là sự nghiệp cả đời! Ông từng nói rằng nuôi dạy con thành tài là sự nghiệp bức thiết suốt một đời làm cha mẹ. Nó mãi mãi là việc quan trọng nhất trong mọi công việc hàng ngày! Ông chỉ là một người cha bình thường nhưng đã nuôi dạy được sáu người con thành tài với những thành tựu về học vấn đáng để bất cứ ai cũng phải ao ước.\nHãy xem sự khác biệt nào trong quan điểm giáo dục của Thái Tiếu Vãn đã đem đến thành công rực rỡ của ông trong “sự nghiệp cả đời mình”:\n- Trong khi những bậc cha mẹ khác coi giai đoạn từ 0 - 3 tuổi là giai đoạn trẻ chưa tiếp thu tri thức và nhận biết thế giới, để khoảng thời gian khai phá trí tuệ quý báu nhất của trẻ trôi qua một cách vô ích thì ông lại cho rằng có thể giáo dục con trẻ ngay từ nhỏ nên đã cố gắng hết sức tiến hành giáo dục sớm cho con ngay từ những năm tháng đầu đời.\n- Trong khi các bậc cha mẹ khác vui mừng khi thầy học lực của con minh nhỉnh hơn chúng bạn đôi chút và hài lòng với những giải thưởng cao trong các cuộc thi của con thì ông lại cố gắng nghĩ cách làm thế nào để con có thể phát huy hết ưu thế của mình, tranh thủ thời gian cho con học vượt lớp hoặc theo học lớp tài năng.\n- Trong khi các bậc cha mẹ khác luôn ca ngợi sự xuất sắc của con với mọi người, vô tình tăng thêm áp lực cho con thì ông cố gắng hết sức để con không quá thể hiện mình và được sống trong một môi trường yên bình, không áp lực, tự do phát triển bản thân theo ý nguyện của chính mình.\n- Trong khi các bậc cha mẹ khác thở phào nhẹ nhõm và coi việc thi đỗ đại học là chiến thắng cuối cùng của con thì ông luôn nhắc nhở con rằng, đó mới chỉ là điểm khởi đầu trên con đường tìm hiểu tri thức.\nSự nghiệp làm cha là một câu chuyện dạy con cảm động lòng người. Những triết lý trong cuốn sách không quá cao sâu diệu vợi nhưng vô cùng thiết thực. Mỗi câu chuyện đều tràn đầy tình yêu thương ấm áp và sự hy sinh của người cha trước những bước trưởng thành của các con. Ý thức và quan điểm giáo dục tiên tiến đem lại hiệu quả lâu dài đã khiến Sự nghiệp làm cha trở thành sách gối đầu giường của nhiều bậc phụ huynh. Tuy giáo dục sớm không thay đổi được bản chất của yếu tố di truyền, nhưng nó có tầm ảnh hưởng lớn đến sự trưởng thành và thành tài của trẻ. Nếu không được giáo dục sớm tốt, khi trưởng thành, người có 100 điểm gien di truyền chỉ có thể được thừa hưởng 50 điểm hoặc thấp hơn, còn đứa trẻ chỉ có 60 điểm điểm gen di truyền sẽ được thừa hưởng nó một cách trọn vẹn.\nSau đây là 5 kinh nghiệm thiết thật mà Thái Tiếu Vãn muốn chia sẻ với các bậc cha mẹ thông qua cuốn sách này:\nThứ nhất, coi việc nuôi dạy con thành tài là sự nghiệp của bản thân, đặt lên vị trí hàng đầu trong các công việc hàng ngày, chấp nhận hi sinh mọi thứ vì mục đích đó. Thứ hai, dùng tình yêu để tạo không khí học tập, bồi dưỡng và hỗ trợ lòng tự trọng và sự tự tin cho trẻ.\nThứ ba, những việc muốn con trẻ làm được trước tiên mình phải làm được. Dùng ý chí để khuyến khích ý chí phấn đấu, dùng khí phách để bồi dưỡng khí phách, dùng đạo đức để cảm hóa đạo đức, dùng lý tưởng vĩ đại để hướng bọn trẻ đi theo con đường vĩ đại.\nThứ tư, dùng khó khăn để rèn ý chí, đưa ra những câu chuyện giàu triết lý thấm sâu vào tâm hồn con trẻ từ khi còn nhỏ, bồi dưỡng tinh thần kiên trì theo đuổi mục đích.\nThứ năm, dùng phương pháp khoa học hướng dẫn con trẻ học sớm, học có chọn lọc, đồng thời bồi dưỡng khả năng tự học, phát triển thế mạnh, bồi dưỡng sở thích cho con trẻ.\n",

Trẻ đã làm thế nào để hoàn thành những “nhiệm vụ bất khả thi” ấy, để thích ứng với thế giới phức tạp này?\nMontessori từng nói: “Những đứa trẻ trải qua thời kì nhạy cảm đang nhận sự “chỉ huy” từ một mệnh lệnh thần kì trong vô thức, ngay cả tâm hồn bé nhỏ của chúng cũng nhận được sự khích lệ”.Trong quá trình phát triển từ 0~6 tuổi, trẻ chịu sự chi phối của sức sống nội tại, ở một giai đoạn nào đó sẽ vô cùng chú ý tới những đặc trưng của sự vật trong một môi trường nào đó, đồng thời không ngừng lặp lại quá trình thực tiễn. Sau khi thuận lợi vượt qua thời kì nhạy cảm, trí tuệ của trẻ sẽ được nâng lên một tầm cao mới.\nThời kì nhạy cảm không chỉ là giai đoạn quan trọng cho việc học tập của trẻ mà còn ảnh hưởng đến sự phát triển tâm hồn và tính cách của chúng. Do vậy, các bậc phụ huynh nên tôn trọng những hành động mà tự nhiên đã ban tặng cho trẻ, đồng thời đưa ra những định hướng cần thiết, giúp trẻ không bỏ lỡ cơ hội duy nhất này.\n",

    "description": "Bạn đã được làm mẹ, được ôm trên tay sinh linh bé bỏng của mình. Hẳn bạn đang rất băn khoăn và trăn trở với hàng ngàn thắc mắc: làm thế nào để giúp bé làm quen với gia đình, bắt nhịp với cuộc sống mới lạ bên ngoài, làm thế nào để hiểu và đáp ứng đúng những nhu cầu của em bé sơ sinh chỉ mới biết dùng tiếng khóc làm công cụ duy nhất để giao tiếp đây. Những câu hỏi cứ liên tiếp nảy ra, bạn cuống cuồng tìm sự trợ giúp và giải đáp từ nhiều nguồn khác nhau, để rồi dễ dàng rơi vào một vòng xoáy sai lầm và một cuộc chiến mệt mỏi trong sự nghiệp nuôi con nhỏ.\nNhững ngày đầu tiên bạn sẽ cố gắng cho bé bú liên tục, nhằm kích sữa, để con biết đây là mẹ. Đôi khi bạn sẽ đánh thức con dậy để cho con bú khi thấy bé ngủ li bì vì bạn sợ lâu quá con không bú sẽ bị đói. Bạn liên tục tự hỏi: con bú ít thế có đói không? Mình làm như thế có sao không? Con có ngủ được không? Con có nóng không? Con có lạnh không? Và làm thế nào để con tăng cân nhanh nhất có thể. Con tăng cân thế có chậm so với anh, chị, em hay con nhà hàng xóm không?\nKhi được 4 tháng tuổi, tự nhiên bạn thấy con bú ít hẳn, con cáu gắt, con ngủ không yên, con dậy đêm nhiều lần. Bạn nghĩ là con đói, hốt hoảng cho con bú mỗi giờ. Con quấy khóc, chỉ có ti mẹ hay cái bình mới có thể cho con ngủ được. Và chỉ khi ngủ con mới chịu ăn. Mỗi giấc ngủ của con chỉ kéo dài 30 phút rồi con choàng dậy và kích động như chưa bao giờ được nghỉ ngơi. Đêm con dậy liên tục, con đòi bú, bạn nghĩ con ngày bú ít chắc cần bú bù, cả đêm bạn chẳng ngủ vì phục vụ “tiếp dưỡng” cho con. Mẹ mệt và cảm giác càng ngày con càng “khó tính”.6 tháng con bắt đầu ăn dặm, con cứ nhè chẳng ăn được bao nhiêu. Bạn quyết cho con nằm ngửa ra bón để chờ trọng lực của tự nhiên giúp thức ăn “rơi” vào bụng con. Sữa cũng vậy - cách duy nhất để uống sữa là nằm ngửa đút thìa, hay tệ hơn là uống bằng xi-lanh. Con vẫn quấy khóc đêm, dậy liên tục. Bạn cảm giác những đêm mất ngủ có lẽ sẽ kéo dài đến vô tận.\n9 tháng, cân nặng của con mãi không tăng, con cự tuyệt và sợ hãi với thức ăn. Sữa giờ phải bỏ ra đút thìa. Mà kể cả vậy, một thìa vào bụng con thì một thìa rơi xuống đất. Lãng phí. Bạn thấy thất vọng và bất lực với con.Bạn đọc hơn trăm trang tài liệu ăn dặm, các loại Tây Tàu Nhật Thổ, nhưng dường như con bạn là đối tượng không phù hợp với bất cứ phương pháp nào.\nBạn đọc hơn trăm trang tài liệu ăn dặm, các loại Tây Tàu Nhật Thổ, nhưng dường như con bạn là đối tượng không phù hợp với bất cứ phương pháp nào.\nMười mấy tháng con chào đời, bạn những tưởng con càng lớn sẽ càng dễ, nhưng không, mọi sự trở nên khó hơn. Lúc này, mỗi bữa ăn bạn phải cho con ra đường đi dạo, phải cho ra sân chơi, phải có đồ chơi nếu con ngồi ghế, đi ăn nhà hàng là một cơn ác mộng. Con có thể đòi hỏi nhiều điều không tưởng, và bạn đáp ứng vô điều kiện, miễn là con ăn…. Cuối cùng con cũng không muốn ăn. Rồi con ăn vạ, con khóc, con dọa nôn ra thức ăn, và thế là bạn lại tìm mọi cách thực hiện yêu sách miễn là con không ăn vạ, con không nôn kẻo con lại sụt cân….\nBạn những tưởng con qua nấc 1 tuổi sẽ có thể cho bạn một giấc ngủ nguyên đêm, nhưng không, con vẫn thức dậy vài lần, mỗi đêm trằn trọc không ngon giấc. Bạn đi khám mọi bác sỹ dinh dưỡng, uống đủ các loại men tiêu hóa và cảm giác bất lực càng thêm bất lực vì bạn không thể thay đổi tự nhiên, không thể làm con béo, hay con ngủ ngoan…Hơn thế nữa, lúc nào bạn cũng cảm thấy như có thêm cái đuôi bất đắc dĩ, bạn vừa chạy ra ngoài 5 phút thì ở trong phòng đã nghe tiếng khóc nức nở. Bạn đi vào nhà tắm làm công tác bí mật cũng phải có khán giả bất đắc dĩ vừa nhăn mũi vừa nhăm nhăm trèo lên lòng . Lâu hơn chút, bạn cảm giác như mình có thêm ông vua bà chúa con trong nhà, thích gì là phải có ngay lập tức, trái ý là lăn đùng ra đất giãy giụa, tiếng khóc át tiếng bom, thậm chí còn dọa đập đầu vào tường, càng ở chốn đông người thì bạn càng được nghe ca nhạc kịch với âm lượng quá tải.\nBạn thường xuyên trong tâm trạng lo sợ con ngã, con khóc; đôi khi bạn cảm thấy xấu hổ khi thấy người đi đường ngoái lại nhìn rồi xì xào nên lại chạy ra bế, ra ôm và lại đáp ứng mọi nhu cầu của các thượng đế tí hon. Hay thỉnh thoảng khi con bị ngã, bạn liền lập tức ra tay “đánh chừa” này, đôi khi ông bà cha mẹ lại được con “phát” miễn phí vài cái tát, hay vài dấu răng trên tay, trên vai. Những tưởng lớn dần bạn nói con sẽ hiểu, thế nhưng đời đâu như mơ, một ngày đẹp trời, thiên thần nhỏ của bạn chỉ biết nói duy nhất từ “không” đối với tất cả những gì bạn yêu cầu hay đòi hỏi ở con: tắm xong thì nhất quyết không chịu mặc quần áo, không chịu ngồi yên một chỗ để ăn, không chịu cất đồ chơi. Nói nhẹ không được chuyển qua nói nặng rồi ép buộc rồi dọa nạt, thế là ngôi nhà biến thành trận chiến nơi có tiếng la hét quát tháo của mẹ và những cơn nức nở của con…\nNếu bất cứ trường hợp nào trên đây giống như những gì xảy ra ở gia đình bạn, thì cuốn sách này là dành cho bạn!\nCuốn sách không là cẩm nang để bé ăn nhiều tăng cân nhanh hay dạy bé nghe lời răm rắp, mà giúp bạn hiểu con mình hơn. Giúp bạn hiểu chu kỳ sinh học của con và cách phối kết hợp cuộc sống gia đình với chu kỳ sinh học đó của bé. Hơn thế, cuốn sách còn hướng dẫn bạn cách cho ăn khi con đói, các thông tin kinh nghiệm và các trường hợp thực tế áp dụng thành công của các “bà mẹ tuyệt vọng” khác giúp bạn có thông tin cũng như nghị lực thay đổi cách áp dụng nuôi và dạy con ở gia đình. Suy cho cùng, nuôi không hẳn đã khó, đến đoạn dạy con còn khó hơn nhiều.\nCuối cùng đây là kinh nghiệm đặt những khuôn khổ hợp lý cho từng lứa tuổi, là bài học về tôn trọng trẻ thơ trong những khuôn khổ ấy. Nó sẽ làm cho kinh nghiệm làm mẹ của bạn ngọt ngào hơn và tránh cho con một tuổi thơ nước mắt bên bát cơm.\nMục Lục\nPHẦN 1: NUÔI CON KHÔNG PHẢI  CUỘC CHIẾN\nChương 1: Ăn ngủ tự lập - Mẹ Nhàn con Ngoan\nChương 2: Những tuần phát triển kĩ năng và tinh thần (The Wonder Weeks)\nChương 3: Ăn dặm bé tự chủ - Baby-led weaning\nChương 4: Ăn để sống hay sống để ăn?

Sống là để vui cười, những điều khác đều không quan trọng. Cùng con trưởng thành, tâm hồn chúng ta cũng thêm phong phú. Đây là chia sẻ chân thành của một người mẹ bình thường mà ưu tú.\nChị dùng ngòi bút giản dị mà tinh tế của mình, hồi tưởng lại từng dấu chân trưởng thành của con trong những năm tiểu học. Ở mỗi chương, cuốn sách chia sẻ hành trình giáo dục, đồng hành cùng con của tác giả từ cuộc sống xung quanh, việc đọc sách, việc học tập, cho tới xây dựng phẩm chất, tâm lý và cách giao lưu, làm bạn với con.

Trong giáo dục không có chuyện gì là nhỏ cả, hãy làm một người cha người mẹ có trái tim, chuyên tâm, để cho mọi việc, mọi lúc, mọi nơi đều trở thành cầu nối giữa bạn và con, dẫn dắt con trưởng thành.” (Dương Tuyết Dương)\n",

Đến 5 tuổi, trẻ có khả năng đạt được một mức độ căn bản về tình cảm, xã hội và tri thức nếu chúng được nuôi dưỡng trong một môi trường thích hợp. Trong môi trường này, trẻ có cơ hội thể hiện và phát huy tính độc lập đang bắt đầu hình thành và đáp ứng tốt nhất những nhu cầu cả về thể chất lẫn tinh thần của bản thân.\nThực trạng đáng báo động khi hiện nay có rất nhiều trẻ em không thể phát huy hết các năng lực cần có theo độ tuổi. Người ta đã đưa ra rất nhiều lý do để lý giải điều này. Đó có thể là do điều kiện kinh tế, hoặc do cách nuôi dạy con chưa phù hợp và cũng có thể là do hậu quả của các xu hướng trái ngược nhau trong xã hội ngày nay. Những bậc cha mẹ ít gần gũi với con có thể tạo ra những ức chế trong quá trình phát triển tình cảm và xã hội của trẻ, tạo ra một khoảng cách trong quan hệ tình cảm với con. Tuy nhiên, nguyên nhân sâu xa của tình trạng này không phải do điều kiện kinh tế mà chủ yếu là do cha mẹ không quan tâm đầy đủ đến những nhu cầu của trẻ.\nKhi nghiên cứu vai trò của hạnh phúc trong đời sống mỗi cá nhân, kết quả cho thấy việc vui chơi giúp trẻ duy trì một sức khoẻ tốt hơn, cả về thể chất lẫn tinh thần, góp phần tăng cường khả năng phục hồi tình cảm, phát huy tính sáng tạo và đem đến nhiều cơ hội thành công khi trẻ trưởng thành. Ở lứa tuổi mới chập chững biết đi này, trẻ rất dễ rơi vào tình trạng căng thẳng tâm lý, dù là với những tình huống mà chúng ta vẫn nghĩ là bình thường trong cuộc sống của người lớn. Vì vậy cha mẹ cần tạo ra sự cân bằng hợp lý trong gia đình để đạt được sự hài hoà giữa việc khích lệ trẻ phát triển toàn diện với việc đáp ứng những nhu cầu của cha mẹ.\nNội dung cuốn sách đề cập đến những mối quan tâm phổ biến của các bậc cha mẹ cùng với những lời khuyên thiết thực và hữu ích về cách giao tiếp với trẻ. Những hiểu biết này giúp chúng ta hiểu rõ hơn về những cảm xúc của trẻ, cũng như dạy cho trẻ kỹ năng sống độc lập hơn. Sách cũng hướng dẫn những phương pháp hữu ích để cha mẹ duy trì cũng như làm tăng cảm xúc hạnh phúc, lòng tự tin và những thói quen tốt cho trẻ. Tất cả chính là nền móng quan trọng cho quá trình phát triển về mặt tình cảm và xã hội của trẻ, là tiền đề giúp trẻ lớn lên khoẻ mạnh và đạt được thành công trong tương lai.\n",

Thế nhưng những thứ đó đang dần bị đánh cắp mà chúng ta không hề hay biết. Qua cuốn sách tác giả nhấn mạnh rằng: những quyền đương nhiên của con người không chỉ có quyền sống, quyền tự do, quyền mưu cầu hạnh phúc. Con người còn đương nhiên có quyền không bị ô nhiễm, quyền thưởng thức văn hóa và hưởng các tiến bộ khoa học không giới hạn, quyền được chữa bệnh, quyền được có những nền tảng công bằng để bước vào đời.\nKhông những thế, tác giả còn vạch ra những quyền đương nhiên có mà các thế hệ tương lai dù hiện chưa có mặt vẫn có quyền đòi hỏi chúng ta phải đảm bảo cho họ: quyền được nhận từ chúng ta một môi trường sống đầy đủ và nguyên vẹn như khi chúng ta nhận từ cha ông chúng ta. Tất cả những vấn đề này sẽ được giải quyết theo đúng quy luật thị trường trong hệ điều hành kinh tế nâng cấp của Chủ nghĩa tư bản 3.0 do tác giả đề xuất.\nTựa sách thuộc nhóm Sách cũ, sách tồn kho...

    "description": "Đỗ Nhật Nam được biết đến không chỉ là dịch giả trẻ tuổi nhất Việt Nam, cậu bé thần đồng với tài hùng biện đầy thuyết phục mà còn là người con hiếu thảo, luôn biết yêu thương cha mẹ một cách ngọt ngào nhất.\nNhật Nam đã tạo cho mình một khối thành tích học tập đáng ngưỡng mộ, Nam còn biết làm thơ, làm MC… và là tác giả của ba cuốn sách khi mới qua tuổi lên mười. Thêm một điều kỳ diệu nữa mà ít khi có được: Cả gia đình Nhật Nam cùng ra sách lần này. Nhật Nam có tác phẩm thứ 4 Đường xa con hát; Bố Thảo có cuốn Tròn một vòng yêu thương, mẹ Điệp ra cuốn Yêu thương mẹ kể. Nếu bạn được sở hữu cả 3 cuốn sách này thì bạn đã có một hành trang mà nhiều người muốn ghen tỵ.\nHãy cùng lắng nghe những lời tâm sự chân thành, những xúc cảm ngọt ngào qua từng câu chữ và cảm nhận ngọn lửa yêu thương gia đình ấm áp. Trọn bộ gồm 3 cuốn:\n1. Yêu thương mẹ kể\n\"Mình là mẹ của một cậu bé con tròn trĩnh, tình cảm, hay ríu ra ríu rít kể cho mẹ nghe những chuyện không đầu không cuối. Chỉ bấy nhiêu thôi đủ làm mình thấy mình là người Hạnh phúc nhất trần đời. Mỗi ngày nuôi con, nhìn con lớn lên, mình ngập chìm trong thứ tình cảm mênh mông của tình mẫu tử.\nVà mình mong muốn ghi lại thứ cảm xúc “ma mị” đầy men say đó qua những trang Facebook. Mình không ngờ là có nhiều bà mẹ yêu thích những bài viết của mình. Chắc mọi người tìm được trong đó sự gắn kết của những trái tim làm mẹ.\nNhững trang viết như một lời kể về quá trình lớn lên của Nam, về những câu chuyện tản mạn dọc đường. Đôi khi là viết cho con khi con ở gần hay khi con đang cách xa ngàn dặm. Đôi khi là nói chuyện với các bà mẹ về cách nuôi dạy con từ khi con còn trứng nước. Đôi khi là tự nói với chính mình về cách sống ở đời. Bởi vậy, xin bạn đọc lượng thứ nếu đại từ nhân xưng không thống nhất.\nMình cũng không hề chau chuốt về câu chữ. Chỉ là những lời thủ thỉ từ tâm.\n(...) Cảm ơn bạn đã mang “yêu thương thật thà” của mình về trong lòng bạn.\"\n2. Tròn một vòng yêu thương\n\"Tôi nối mình với mọi người bằng những chân tình, bằng những vui tươi, bằng thế giới nội tâm sâu lắng. Chỉ có điều, khi tôi bắt đầu quen được nhiều bạn, thấy được sự “hay ho” thì “người có tên là Vợ” lại thường “hay nhắc nhở”, “e hèm”. Nhưng chính “người có tên là Vợ” ấy lại khuyến khích tôi tập hợp các bài viết đó thành một tập sách cho đúng với “slogan” trong cuộc sống mà tôi thường áp dụng là: Yêu thương bao la mong lan xa mênh mang! Rồi không chỉ Vợ, những học trò cũ, những người bạn đã gặp, những người bạn tôi chưa từng gặp cũng giục giã tôi in các bài tản mạn trên Facebook thành sách. Đặc biệt, “nhân tình” bé nhỏ của tôi luôn thì thầm: “Gia tài” của bố đừng cồng kềnh quá, thành một cuốn sách bé xinh để con có thể mang theo mỗi lúc xa bố ngàn dặm. Đó cũng chính là lý do cuốn sách này có trên tay bạn.\nTựa như một nụ hoa, tựa như những giọt sương, tôi hy vọng sau khi đọc xong, bạn thấy lòng bình an. Những lúc ấy, bạn lại có mong muốn được trở về giữa gia đình mình, lặng nghe hơi ấm của tin yêu.\nBấy nhiêu đã quá đủ làm quà tặng cho trái tim tôi!\"\n3. Đường xa con hát\n\"Nhật Nam viết ở bên kia bán cầu còn tôi ngồi đọc tại Sài Gòn, phía Nam của đất nước hình chữ S. Tôi như bị lac vào thế giới của Nhật Nam. Mỗi bài thơ là một câu chuyện. Từng bài thơ là những cảm xúc của cậu bé được cấu tạo bởi bảy mươi ngàn tỷ tế bào yêu thương. Yêu thương của con tuôn trào từ tâm can tràn lên những trang giấy, tràn vào máy tính, truyền qua Internet đi muôn nơi. Tình yêu thương của con rất mộc mạc và dung dị, rất ấm cúng và gần gũi, rất sống động và tạo cảm xúc lắng đọng. Lạ lắm. Thế là tôi đọc rất nhiều lần, rất nhiều.\nVề Hà Nội, tôi lại mang thơ con ra đọc. Bây giờ cách đọc của tôi đã hoàn toàn khác. Đọc mỗi bài một ngày. Tôi cứ cảm giác rằng đây là kho lương khô, mỗi ngày anh bộ đội - tôi chỉ được ăn một phong. Phải như vậy mới thấy hết giá trị của từng câu từng chữ, của tâm huyết, của một tấm lòng. Đọc rồi tôi có cảm giác như mình đi trong sương đêm, không thấy mưa nhưng nước ngấm dần vào làm ướt hết quần áo tôi, ướt tóc, ướt đầu tôi....\"\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Tập đại thành Tiểu thuyết kỳ ảo của J.R.R. Tolkien\nChúa tể những chiếc nhẫn được viết trong thời kỳ tác giả dạy học ở Oxford, từ năm 1937 đến 1949; nhưng những phác thảo đầu tiên về Arda đã bắt đầu từ 1917, khi ông đang dưỡng thương trong quá trình tham chiến ở Pháp. Buổi sáng thế từ Âm nhạc của các Ainur, những cuộc di cư lớn của người Tiên, chuyện tình giữa Beren và Lúthien, trận chiến quy mô vũ trụ giữa các Valar cùng người Tiên với Morgoth mà Sauron chỉ là một gã học trò, tất cả đã thành hình từ lâu trước khi lần đầu tiên ông nghĩ tới giống dân Hobbit. Và câu chuyện về cuộc Nhẫn Chiến trở thành một nối tiếp tự nhiên, Kỷ Đệ Tam, theo sau những thời đại hoàng kim kia. Tolkien mong muốn tạo ra một sử thi không kém Beowulf hoặc Kalevala, nhưng những gì ông làm được có lẽ còn rộng hơn thế.\nMột trong những điểm hấp dẫn chính của Chúa tể những chiếc Nhẫn lại không nằm trong những trang sách: mà là trong sự tồn tại của câu chuyện với tư cách một mảnh ghép làm thành “hệ truyền thuyết” (legendarium - chữ của Tolkien) về Trung Địa; nói cách khác, trong sự tồn tại của Trung Địa như một lục địa bên trong Arda (thế giới này), đến lượt nó lại nằm trong Eä (vũ trụ).\nTrọn bộ gồm 4 tập: Đoàn hộ nhẫn, Hai tòa tháp, Nhà vua trở về, Danh pháp trong chúa tể những chiếc nhẫn\nNhận định\n“Cộng đồng Anh ngữ được phân làm hai: những người đã đọc Anh chàng Hobbit cùng Chúa tể những chiếc Nhẫn, và những người sẽ đọc.”\n(Sunday Times)\n“Tín đồ Thiên Chúa giáo chưa đọc hết Kinh thánh còn có thể tạm tha thứ, chứ một fan tiểu thuyết kỳ ảo mà chưa đọc cuốn phúc âm của thể loại kỳ ảo này thì không thể chấp nhận được.”\n(Amazon.com)\n“Cuốn thứ hai... là một tác phẩm phi thường: nỗi hứng khởi tinh ròng, lời văn sáng sủa, đạo lý thấm thía, ca tụng cái đẹp không dè dặt - mà hứng khởi vẫn là trên hết; nhưng đây lại là một câu chuyện đứng đắn và nghiêm khắc chứ chẳng hề gần gũi, chẳng phải những chuyến viếng thăm nho nhỏ về thế giới tuổi thơ.”\n(New York Times)\n“Là cảm hứng bất tận cho mô phỏng sau này, là đỉnh cao mãi mãi chưa ai vượt qua được.”\n(Kansas City Star)\n\n",

Cuộc sống của hắn thay đổi.Số phận của hắn thay đổi. Vận may bỏ hắn mà đi.\nNhững ước mơ đổ vỡ, những hạnh phúc rời xa, tuổi thanh xuân đi qua và dồn đến biết bao là nghĩa vụ. Nhưng giữa những trùng trùng khó khăn đó, kẻ đáng ra phải ghé vai cùng chịu trách nhiệm lại ngoảnh mặt làm ngơ, đem sự lạnh lùng hờ hững trả lời cho bao tâm sự ấp ủ và nhớ mong của hắn.\nKhông chịu buông xuôi ở đây, hắn bèn tìm cách truy thu, không lấy được lãi thì ít ra cũng vãn hồi về chút vốn…\nHạ tân lang\nTình yêu vô vọng… Nhưng dù vô vọng, cũng phải yêu thì mới có thể gọi là tình yêu.\nTừ khu vườn oi ả của mùa hè năm ấy cho đến gian phòng mờ tối ở thanh lâu năm nay, hai người đã trải qua rất nhiều tháng ngày đam mê, nhưng lại luôn từ chối buông mình vào vũng lầy tình ái.\nBiết chuyện yêu đương của họ là ngang trái…\nBiết truyền thống và gia phong sẽ gây trở ngại…\nNhìn mối quan hệ của những cặp đôi chính thức cứ rệu rã đổ sập xuống quanh mình…\nHọ thủ thỉ bên nhau đừng nghĩ đến ngày mai, đừng tin vào khả năng tồn tại của một túp lều tranh hai quả tim mơ, còn hứa với nhau sẽ đến góp vui trong ngày mỗi người lấy vợ.\nThanh xuân qua đi, nông nổi qua đi, bạn bè và những cuộc vui tàn canh đều tan biến cả, trưởng thành lừng lững tiến lại với những đòi hỏi không thể chối từ. Ngày y thành thân, hắn không thể nào gồng mình đến được. Ngày nhà hắn có chuyện, y chỉ biết lặng thầm xót xa.\nHọ cố quên tình yêu, nhưng tình yêu lại không chịu quên họ.\nThay cho nến, tường, giường, chiếu… chứng nhân cho quan hệ hai người giờ chỉ là vầng tịch dương đo đỏ, những bước sánh vai trên con đường nhỏ, những buổi gặp gỡ không trọn vẹn sau giờ làm…\nTrở lại bước đầu tinh khôi, mà lại dữ dội hơn hẳn.

    "description": "Tuổi trẻ là một khối dồn nén. Nó có sức phá hoại đến nỗi, vào một thời điểm những tưởng đã quay lưng với cuộc đời, ta chợt nhìn lại và thấy vần vũ quanh mình những gương mặt, mối tình, những lần gặp gỡ, các cảm xúc chân thực và sống động như dao cứa. Cuộc sống về cơ bản là buồn, nhưng với Modiano, viết trở thành một hình thức hòa giải, một sự hòa giải liên tục và quy hồi, xoay quanh trục ký ức, với hình ảnh của tuổi trẻ và tình yêu không thể lãng quên. Viết là để tiếp tục và không bị mắc kẹt, và câu chuyện chính là quá trình chậm rãi của việc tái dựng niềm tin giữa những cá nhân bị thương tổn. Các nhân vật của Modiano đều khao khát muốn biết họ đến từ đâu, nhưng bao trùm tất thảy là việc không thể biết chính xác; tất cả là sự lập lờ. Thời gian mù mờ xoay quanh những tên người, tên phố, các địa chỉ quá thực, quá Paris, dẫn chiếu đến thời thơ ấu và niên thiếu của chính tác giả.\n1. Ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối là mê cung của nỗi cô đơn, mê cung được tạo ra bởi sự tăng động của trí nhớ. Liệu những con đường ta qua thời tuổi trẻ có thực sự là đường vòng? Hay chỉ đơn giản là một đường thẳng, dẫn về phía nội tâm. Đó là tình cảnh của Roland, nhân vật tuy xuất hiện về cuối trong “Ở quán cà phê của tuổi trẻ lạc lối” nhưng lại là mắt xích giải đáp cho mớ ngổn ngang còn lại. Một ngày bước qua quán cà phê La Condé thời xưa cũ rồi nhận ra quán đã đổi thành một cửa hiệu khác, Roland tái dựng ký ức về một cô gái mà anh đã gặp, đã yêu và đánh mất.\n2. Phố những cửa hiệu u tối đạt giải thưởng Goncourt, giải vǎn học quan trọng nhất của Pháp,là nỗi khắc khoải triền miên về nguy cơ đánh mất danh tính và bản cách.Điều gì đã thúc đẩy anh chàng Guy Roland, nhân viên của một hãng thám tử tư, lao theo dấu vết của một người không quen biết đã mất tích từ lâu? Đó là nhu cầu da diết tìm lại được mình sau bao đời của con người vốn xưa kia có thể là anh ta, kiên nhẫn lần mò về những nơi có thể đã từng chứng kiến cuộc tình của anh ta với một người đàn bà giờ đây đã biệt tǎm, cố bấu vào những bóng mờ của những nhân chứng duy nhất từng tham dự vào thời thanh xuân của gã môi giới hàng mang hộ chiếu đáng ngờ dưới cái tên Patro Mc Evoy, mà, cuối cùng, anh ta tin rằng chính là mình.\n3. Từ thăm thẳm lãng quên với bộ ba nhân vật Jaquenline, Van Bever rồi Peter Rachman, Paris và London của giai đoạn hậu chiến dần dà làm cho chúng ta hiểu rằng vỏ bọc quá khứ mịn màng hoàn toàn có thể chứa đựng những kỷ niệm đâu đớn đến thế nào, những kỷ niệm ngủ yên nhưng sẽ quay trở lại quấy nhiễu chúng ta sau từng quãng thời gian mười lăm năm. Cuốn sách không chỉ dệt nên mối quan hệ kỳ lạ giữa quá khứ và thực tại, mà còn tạo ra những mối liên hệ với các tiểu thuyết khác của Patrick Modiano\n",

    "description": "1. Sự dịu dàng khó cưỡng\nSinh nhật lần thứ 14, Quan Tiểu Úc gặp tình yêu sét đánh tại Bule Pub. Anh chàng lạ mắt trông cao quý và hấp dẫn đã thu hút ánh nhìn và trái tim cô bé mới lớn. Rồi khi nhìn chàng trai xa lạ kia khoác vai người đẹp rời đi, “mối tình đầu thơ ngây” của cô bỗng tan thành mây khói.\nNăm cô 22 tuổi, bố mẹ cô sắp xếp một cuộc gặp mặt với Âu Dương Y Phàm, anh chàng nổi tiếng đẹp trai, giỏi giang, con nhà gia, hai nhà đã có hẹn ước với nhau từ nhỏ. Nhưng vì nghe nói anh ta là một “hoa hoa công tử”, thay người yêu còn nhanh hơn cả thay áo, Quan Tiểu Úc chưa kịp gặp mặt đã lén trốn đi mất. Cô rất ghét loại người như anh ta.\nRời khỏi quán trà, cô vô tình đụng phải Ivan, anh chàng đẹp trai cô tình cờ gặp trong bữa tiệc sinh nhật một người bạn. Và trong lúc “nguy cấp”, cô đã lên xe anh ta để chạy trốn khỏi cuộc gặp không mong muốn. Tiếp xúc nhiều với Ivan, cô mới hiểu đằng sau khuôn mặt bất cần đời, luôn ung dung, tươi cười kia là một người hết lòng vì bạn bè, một con người quyết đoán trong công việc đầy áp lực và hơn hết là một trái tim si tình trong tình yêu. Dần dần cô có cảm tình rồi rung động trước Ivan, quyết định cho anh cơ hội để có thể trở thành bạn trai của cô.\nNhưng định mệnh thật trớ trêu khi đến sinh nhật lần thứ 23, Tiểu Úc phát hiện tên hoa hoa công tử Âu Dương Y Phàm và Ivan hóa ra chỉ là một người…\nTrong truyện “Sự dịu dàng khó cưỡng”, độc giả còn gặp lại nhân vật Lăng Lăng - bạn cùng phòng của Quan Tiểu Úc và Giáo sư Dương Lam Hàng - anh họ của Âu Dương Y Phàm trong “Mãi mãi là bao xa” và câu chuyện tình yêu lãng mạn của họ; anh chàng Lâm Quân Dật trong “Chân trời góc bể”.\n2. Nửa kiếp hồng trần, một khúc du ca\nTần Phong - Một lãng tử giang hồ với khuôn mặt hấp dẫn ánh nhìn của mọi thiếu nữ nhưng lại là người lãnh đạm nhất, vô tình nhất với một trái tim chưa từng biết rung động.\nMạc Tình - Một thiếu nữ mang vẻ đẹp tinh khiết nhất, nàng là Minh chủ Du Minh Môn thần bí, nàng xinh đẹp tuyệt mĩ nhưng trong mắt cả thiên hạ nàng lại là một ma nữ máu lạnh, giết người không chớp mắt.\nLãng tử giang hồ ôm mối thù muốn diệt trừ ma nữ tàn ác đã khiến bằng hữu của chàng tàn phế, có ngờ đâu gặp lại chính thiếu nữ trong hồi ức ngày nào.\nÂn ân oán oán, thị phi giang hồ, cuối cùng tình yêu này sẽ dẫn Tần Phong và Mạc Tình đến đâu?\nTình là thứ động lòng người nhất, nàng tên Mạc Tình nhưng cả đời lại khổ vì tình.\nGió là thứ vô tình nhất nhưng lại vì tình mà dừng bước, cuối cùng biến mất trong không khí.\nCâu chuyện “Nửa kiếp hồng trần, một khúc du ca” với tên gọi quen thuộc trên mạng là “Gió chớ động tình” được coi là phần tiếp theo của “Ngàn năm chờ đợi”, Tần Phong và Mạc Tình chính là kiếp đầu tiên dưới thế gian của Thanh Ngưng và Y Vân trong “Ngàn năm chờ đợi”.\n3. Sự cám dỗ cuối cùng\nNăm 10 tuổi, Giản Nhu lần đầu tiên gặp Trịnh Vĩ, cậu thiếu niên đẹp trai có sức hút kỳ lạ đối với cô. Họ trở thành những người bạn thân thiết và tình cảm đầu đời đã đến rất trong sáng và thuần khiết.\nNăm cô 14 tuổi, sự cố xảy ra bất ngờ với gia đình cô, bố cô - một phóng viên - ngã từ tầng cao xuống đất, qua đời, mẹ cô và em gái bị xe đâm, gia đình cô tan nát; vì thế cô đã không thể gặp Trịnh Vĩ ở rạp chiếu phim như đã hẹn và cuộc đời cô bước sang một trang mới…\n17 tuổi, để kiếm tiền chu cấp cho mẹ và tiền chưa bệnh cho em gái, Giản Nhu từ bỏ ước mơ múa ba lê mà bước chân vào làng giải trí. Là một cô gái xinh đẹp và cá tính, có chút bướng bỉnh, cô hiểu những “quy tắc ngầm”, mặt trái phù phiếm của thế giới giải trí bề ngoài hào nhoáng nhưng không bao giờ cho phép mình “sa chân” để nổi tiếng. Phải đóng vai diễn viên quần chúng, diễn viên đóng thế rồi vai phụ, bị nhà quản lý “đóng băng” để gây sức ép buộc cô phải “bán mình” để có cơ hội được đóng vai vai nữ chính, trở thành nữ diễn viên hạng nhất nhưng Giản Nhu trước sau kiên quyết từ chối, dù phải tự làm mình bị thương.\nNăm 18 tuổi, Giản Nhu gặp lại Trịnh Vĩ, anh chủ động đến tìm cô trong bộ quân phục. Sau 4 năm xa cách, tình cảm trong sáng đầu đời một lần nữa có cơ hội được nhen lên và nó đã bùng cháy thành tình yêu đầu nồng nàn, tha thiết, tưởng như không thể chia lìa. Họ sống ở 2 thành phố, anh đang học trường quân đội kỷ luật rất nghiêm ngặt, cô đang là diễn viên công việc rất bận rộn, nhưng họ vẫn dành cho nhau những ngày cuối tuần nồng nàn, những buổi hẹn lãng mạn, tình yêu đẹp như bản tình ca trong bộ phim họ đã hứa xem cùng nhau “Titanic”.\nNhưng số phận lại một lần nữa tàn nhẫn với Giản Nhu khi cô phát hiện ra một bí mật động trời về cái chết của bố cô. Bí mật có liên quan đến thân thế của Trịnh Vĩ và cũng vì lý do này, Giản Nhu đã dứt khoát chia tay với Trịnh Vĩ bằng phương thức tổn thương nhất. Khi đó cô mới 19 tuổi.\n5 năm sau, trong lúc sự nghiệp đang đà lên phơi phới và tưởng như cô đã dứt bỏ được quá khứ phía sau lưng thì bất ngờ cô gặp lại anh, người mà cô đã cố tình lảng tránh suốt từng ấy năm và lần này, anh không cho phép cô có thể tránh né mình được nữa…\nTrong “Leo cao” xuất hiện khá nhiều các nhân vật của các tiểu thuyết trước của Diệp Lạc Vô Tâm.  Đó là Trác Siêu Nhiên, Trác Siêu Việt trong “Gió mang ký ức thổi thành những cánh hoa”; Diệp Chính Thần, Bạc Băng trong “Động phòng hoa chúc cách vách” và Dương Lam Hàng, Bạch Lăng Lăng trong “Mãi mãi là bao xa”.\n",

    "description": "Được vinh danh là một trong “Tứ đại danh tác” hay “Tứ đại kỳ thư” của Trung Quốc, cho đến nay Tam Quốc Diễn Nghĩa đã trở thành danh tác thế giới bởi số lượng bản dịch và tầm phổ biến rộng khắp.\nTam Quốc Diễn Nghĩa tên đầy đủ là \"Tam Quốc chí thông tục diễn nghĩa\" là tiểu thuyết lịch sử chương hồi nổi tiếng của Trung Quốc do nhà văn La Quán Trung sống vào khoảng cuối đời Nguyên, đầu đời Thanh viết. Bản Tam Quốc lưu truyền rộng rãi nhất ngày nay là bản do Mao Tôn Cương tu sắc và bình chú.\nVề mặt nội dung, Tam Quốc là pho sử thi dựng lại gần một trăm năm lịch sử Trung Quốc cổ đại từ thời  Đông Hán cho đến những năm đầu của triều đại Tây Tấn một cách bao quát và toàn diện gồm cả những cuộc đấu tranh chính trị, quân sự cho đến diễn tiến của mâu thuẫn xã hội dựa trên quan điểm “Ủng Lưu phản Tào” (Ủng hộ Lưu Bị, phản đối Tào Tháo).\nVề mặt nghệ thuật, Tam Quốc là mẫu mực của thể loại tiểu thuyết lịch sử chương hồi Trung Quốc. Với bạn đọc thế giới, Tam Quốc đã xây dựng được nhiều nhân vật điển hình có tính cách điển hình: Tào Tháo gian hùng, Lưu Bị nhân từ, Quan Công trượng nghĩa, Trương Phi nóng này...\nTuy có một số hạn chế nhưng Tam Quốc vẫn là tác phẩm kinh điển như lời nhận xét của chính Mao Tôn Cương:\n“Tam Quốc phảng phất Sử Ký của Tư Mã Thiên nhưng chuyện Tam Quốc khó kể gấp mấy Sử Ký. Sử Ký được chia ra các phần nói riêng về từng nước. Nhân vật cũng được tả riêng. Cho nên có những bản kỷ, thế gia, liệt truyện riêng biệt. Tam Quốc thì không thế. Phải hợp các bản kỷ, thế gia, liệt truyện lại, rồi viết thành một truyện chung. Chia từng phần thì văn ngắn mà dễ khéo. Hợp lại một thì văn dài mà khó… Cho nên đọc Tam Quốc thú hơn... từ đầu đến cuối mạch lạc liên tục, gay cấn hấp dẫn.”\n",

    "description": "Trả lời câu hỏi của nhiều người thắc mắc vì sao lại viết cuốn sách Dạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của cái đầu gối bị trầy xước, tác giả trả lời:\n“Tôi viết sách để nhắc nhở bản thân mình làm theo những gì được viết trong đó. Và điều này gần như luôn có tác dụng. Bằng cách sử dụng những bài học của đạo Do Thái do chính mình nhắc đến trong cuốn sách, tôi đã không còn bao bọc thái quá, luôn lên sẵn lịch trình, nuông chiều và đặt những kỳ vọng cao ngút trời vào con cái  những thứ vốn là chuẩn mực của vùng Los Angeles, nơi tôi nuôi dạy hai cô con gái nhỏ của mình. Tôi rất rõ ràng và có chiến lược trong việc dạy bọn trẻ biết kính trọng cha mẹ, tôi cũng cố gắng tôn trọng các con bằng cách trân trọng cả tài năng lẫn khuyết điểm của chúng. Ngày nào tôi cũng nhắc bản thân mình nhớ đến câu nói trong đạo Do Thái rằng mọi bậc cha mẹ đều phải dạy con mình học bơi - tôi đã áp dụng triết lý này bằng cách để các con gái mình leo lên những thân cây thật cao, dùng những con dao sắc nhọn, nấu ăn với chiếc chảo nóng và tất nhiên, vì tôi sống ở Nam California, dạy chúng bơi, nhảy từ trên cao và lặn xuống những vùng nước sâu ngay từ khi chúng còn rất nhỏ.\nKhi tôi phát hành cuốn sách đầu tiên, các con tôi mới 9 và 13 tuổi. Tôi đã hoàn toàn tự tin khi nghĩ đến quãng thời gian chúng bắt đầu trưởng thành. Khi các con gái tôi bước vào tuổi mới lớn, tôi đã là một chuyên gia. Thật thế. Tôi là một nhà tâm lý học xã hội, có nghĩa rằng tôi được đào tạo bài bản để nhìn nhận các vấn đề liên quan đến cảm xúc trong từng bối cảnh văn hóa cụ thể. Chuyên ngành của tôi là nuôi dạy con cái và sự phát triển bình thường của trẻ. Tôi đã làm việc với các gia đình trong suốt 30 năm liền. Tôi hiểu về các học thuyết liên quan đến vấn đề cá tính hóa, tác động của tuổi dậy thì đến tính cách, nhịp điệu sinh lý hàng ngày phá vỡ giấc ngủ như thế nào và khao khát phiêu lưu mạo hiểm ở tuổi mới lớn.\nTôi cũng ý thức rất rõ về tác động của nền văn hóa vận động nhanh chóng, đầy cạnh tranh, thô bạo cùng sự phát triển của công nghệ Internet đến việc phát triển một nhân cách tốt ở giới trẻ. Tôi đồng thời rất chú ý đến việc trẻ mới lớn rất dễ bị tổn thương bởi sự lo lắng, thói quen ăn uống bừa bãi, tình trạng tự làm bản thân bị thương, sự thất vọng, các vấn đề liên quan đến học tập, sự chú ý cũng như việc lạm dụng thuốc. Tôi hình dung rằng với hàng tá những bí quyết liên quan đến chuyên môn cũng như tôn giáo, tôi sẽ dẫn các con gái mình vượt qua tất cả những mối nguy hiểm thường thấy của tuổi mới lớn. Và khi bước qua ngưỡng tuổi đó, các con gái tôi sẽ trở thành những con người có trách nhiệm, trưởng thành và là những thành viên gia đình tốt hơn. Dưới sự hướng dẫn chín chắn của tôi, chúng tôi sẽ có những mối quan tâm chung và những cuộc trò chuyện sâu sắc hơn. Vòng quay cuộc sống thường nhật của gia đình tôi cũng sẽ trơn tru hơn khi giờ đây các thành viên trong gia đình đã cao lớn, thông minh, ăn rơ với nhau và sáng tạo hơn.\"\nXin giới thiệu với bạn đọc Combo Dạy Con Kiểu Do Thái gồm 2 quyển:\nDạy Con Kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của cái đầu gối bị trầy xước\nDạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ\n",

    "description": "Đối với độc giả, hình tượng chàng thám tử thông minh, tài giỏi với chiếc kính lúp, cái tẩu trên môi và chiếc mũ lưỡi trai đặc trưng đã trở thành biểu tượng duy nhất, không thể nhầm lẫn với bất kỳ ai.\nNhà văn Conan Doyle cho biết nhân vật Sherlock Holmes của ông được lấy cảm hứng từ vị giáo sư, bác sĩ Joseph Bell, người mà Doyle đã từng làm việc như là thư ký của ông tại bệnh viện Hoàng gia Edinburgh.\nCũng giống như Holmes, ngài Joseph Bell nổi tiếng với những kết luận lớn được rút ra từ những chi tiết nhỏ nhặt nhất. Chính từ tính cách này mà Conan Doyle đã tạo ra tuyên ngôn nghề nghiệp cho Holmes và sau đó đã trở thành một trong những câu nói nổi tiếng nhất mọi thời đại, thậm chí cho đến nay các cơ quan tình báo và an ninh của Anh vẫn sử dụng phương pháp suy luận này để huấn luyện các nhân viên của họ: “Sau khi đã loại trừ tất cả những trường hợp không thể nào xảy ra được, giả thiết còn lại cuối cùng, dù chưa chắc chắn, thiếu cơ sở đến đâu cũng là sự thật”.\nTrong Sherlock Holmes toàn tập cũng như các tác phẩm khác viết về vị thám tử lừng danh này, Holmes luôn tỏ ra là một người lạnh lùng và thờ ơ với mọi thứ không liên quan đến vụ án. Trong khi điều tra, ông ta không bao giờ nói ra những suy luận của mình ngay, chỉ sau khi vụ án đã được phá, Holmes mới tiết lộ tất cả những lập luận dẫn tới việc phá án. Đó cũng chính là phong cách phá án đặc trưng của Holmes, tạo cho độc giả sự hồi hộp, hấp dẫn đến phút cuối. Holmes cũng là người rất can đảm, ông luôn bình thản xem xét hiện trường các vụ án tàn bạo và kinh khủng, ông không cho phép những điều mê tín dị đoan hay những tình huống ma quái, kỳ lạ làm mình khiếp sợ.\nTuy bề ngoài có vẻ là người cô độc, lạnh lùng, nhưng thật ra Holmes lại rất giỏi trong việc nhận xét cảm xúc của người đối diện, ông có thể xoa dịu và làm an lòng những khách hàng đang gặp khủng hoảng về tâm lý.\nKiệt tác của Conan Doyle hấp dẫn người đọc không chỉ bởi các tình tiết li kỳ của vụ án, hay nghiệp vụ phá án tài tình của thám tử Sherlock Holmes mà còn lôi cuốn người đọc bởi sự phân tích, suy luận, phán đoán đến tuyệt vời.\nSherlock Holmes tạo nên sức hút mạnh đối với những người thích truyện trinh thám. Những vụ án do Holmes điều tra thường bắt đầu với việc ông thể hiện khả năng suy luận tuyệt vời của mình như đoán ra thân thế và nghề nghiệp của khách hàng mà không cần hỏi thông tin từ họ.\nSự thành công trong suy luận của Holmes còn do ông có phương pháp nghiên cứu hiện trường vụ án rất khoa học và cẩn thận. Mặt khác do ông rất am hiểu những lĩnh vực liên quan như pháp y hay chất độc nên có những suy luận rất nhạy bén.\nTheo Holmes, những kết luận logic của ông thực ra là \"đơn giản\" và \"hiển nhiên\". Điều quan trọng trong những suy luận của Holmes là phải triệt tiêu được càng nhiều khả năng xảy ra càng tốt. Thêm nữa, Holmes còn nghiên cứu rất sâu những môn cần thiết cho việc phá án. Vì thế ông rất giỏi trong việc giải các loại mật mã, ngoài ra ông còn là bậc thầy về cải trang. Chỉ với một chiếc kính lúp, thám tử Holmes có thể suy đoán nhân dạng thủ phạm từ những dấu vết để lại như vết giày dép, vết bánh xe, vết chân hay tàn thuốc...\nQua bộ tác phẩm đồ sộ về thám tử Sherlock Homles được coi là kinh điển của truyện trinh thám và thực tế cho thấy sức sống trường tồn mãnh liệt của nhân vật này, tài năng của Conan Doyle là một điều không thể phủ nhận.\nNhân vật Sherlock Homles của ông dường như không còn chỉ là một nhân vật hư cấu trong tiểu thuyết nữa, Homles đã bước lên màn bạc, bước vào đời thực qua việc nhân vật này đã có ảnh hưởng sâu rộng như thế nào đến ngành điều tra hình sự trên thế giới.\nNếu nhân vật “Bố già” là biểu tượng được hâm mộ của những tên tội phạm trên cả thế giới thì Homles đã là thần tượng của biết bao con người mơ ước được làm cảnh sát, thám tử điều tra tội phạm phụng sự cho công lý và luật pháp.\n",

    "description": "Hiện nay, các bậc phụ huynh thường quan tâm tới vấn đề giáo dục cho trẻ từ rất sớm. Các bậc phụ huynh cần dành nhiều thời gian cho trẻ, dạy trẻ những kĩ năng sống cần thiết như chào hỏi, chơi những trò chơi thông minh để kích thích các giác quan.\n“Giống các tuyển thủ như Ichiro hay Ishikawa Ryo nếu lúc đầu không có cơ duyên tiếp cận với thể thao thì chắc không thể thành công như ngày hôm nay. Không riêng gì thể thao mà ở tất cả các khía cạnh khác người mang lại cho trẻ hạt giống ước mơ và khát vọng chính là cha mẹ. Đối với những ông bố bà mẹ chưa từng tham gia vào việc giáo dục con thì hãy bắt đầu từ những việc mình có thể.

Điểm khác biệt với người khác chính là cá tính, nếu có thể phát huy cá tính này thì có thể có một cuộc đời hạnh phúc. Để làm được như vậy điều quan trọng là phải quan sát kỹ trẻ, nhận biết và tiếp nhận những trạng thái của trẻ rồi chọn ra con đường phù hợp với trẻ”\n(Trích “Dạy con kiểu Nhật - Giai đoạn trẻ 2 tuổi”)\nTheo phương pháp Kubota thì đây chính là thời điểm mà cha mẹ nên dành sự suy nghĩ nghiêm túc về tương lai của trẻ.

Năm 1908, bà xuất bản cuốn đầu tiên của series kinh điển về cô bé Anne Tóc đỏ và thu được thành công vang dội. Đến nay, cuốn sách đã được xuất bản bằng hơn 30 ngôn ngữ, bán được tới hơn 50 triệu bản, đưa Montgomery thành một trong những nhà văn bestseller của mọi thời đại.

Và Anne, tất nhiên, cũng là một nhà văn tài năng như L. M. Montgomery vậy.\nAnne Tóc Đỏ Ở Đảo Hoàng Tử Edward\nCâu chuyện cũng \"lớn dần\" lên với một thiếu nữ Anne đã biết yêu, ghen tuông và đau khổ.

Vậy mà giờ đây Anne đã vụt lớn thành một thiếu nữ mười sáu tuổi tươi tắn và xinh đẹp. Tuổi mười sáu đặt lên vai cô nhiều trọng trách: một cô giáo làng với tham vọng gieo những ước vọng đẹp đẽ trong tâm hồn trẻ thơ, một sáng lập viên Hội Cải tạo với mong muốn biến Avonlea thành một ngôi làng xanh sạch đẹp hơn, và một người bảo hộ bất đắc dĩ của hai đứa bé sinh đôi mồ côi rất đáng yêu nhưng cũng gây lắm chuyện đau đầu.\nAnne Tóc Đỏ Và Ngôi Nhà Mơ Ước\nGilbert Blythe - tình yêu đích thực của đời Anne - cuối cùng cũng trở thành bác sĩ, và trong ánh nắng tỏa ngời khu vườn quả, giữa những bạn bè thân thiết nhất, họ nói lời thề ước bên nhau trọn đời.

    "description": "Đầu năm 2008, Mật mã Tây Tạng xuất hiện trên internet  và đã trở thành một tác phẩm văn học mạng thu hút hàng triệu lượt đọc. Chưa đầy một tuần sau khi phát hành, trong kho sách đã không còn sót lại cuốn nào. Trong khi đó, hơn một trăm nhà xuất bản trên khắp thế giới, bao gồm cả tập đoàn Penguin của Mỹ đang ra sức cạnh tranh giành quyền xuất bản Mật Mã Tây Tạng ở nước ngoài. Tác giả Hà Mã trở thành tác giả có sức thu hút nhất tại Trung Quốc. Mật mã Tây Tạng còn trở thành cảm hứng cho một  game online hiện rất thịnh hành tại Trung Quốc.\nChuyến phiêu lưu trên đất Tây Tạng được bắt đầu tại một khán phòng trên đất Mỹ. Trác Mộc Cường Ba - người đàn ông sinh ra trên đất Tây Tạng, hiện đã là một thương nhân thành danh, giàu có với nghề nuôi dạy và kinh doanh chó Ngao Tây Tạng. Nhưng, giữa bài phát biểu khai mạc cuộc thi chó Ngao quốc tế do công ty mình tổ chức, Trác Mộc Cường Ba nhận được hai tấm ảnh bí ẩn khiến anh mất hết tự chủ, sẵn sàng vứt bỏ cuộc thi quay trở lại Trung Quốc. Hai tấm ảnh chụp một con chó ngao kỳ quái mà Trác Mộc Cường Ba nhất định tin rằng chính là Tử Kỳ Lân trong truyền thuyết nghìn năm mà đất Tây Tạng vẫn lưu truyền. Không thể chậm trễ hơn, Cường Ba tìm cách thuyết phục người thầy vốn là giáo sư uyên thâm về chó ngao đi cùng anh về quê nhà Tây Tạng, lần theo dấu vết mà tấm ảnh hé lộ để tìm cho được Tử Kỳ Lân trong truyền thuyết. Nhưng, Trác Mộc Cường Ba không ngờ rằng trong chuyến đi định mệnh này, anh còn phải gánh vác trách nhiệm tìm kiếm cho được bộ Tạng kinh quý hiếm ngàn năm vốn do người Qua Ba giữ gìn. Và mọi chuyện sẽ ra sao khi giữa muôn trùng núi non hùng vỹ, thiên nhiên hiểm trở là những kẻ thù dấu mặt quyết săn đuổi hai thầy trò Trác Mộc Cường Ba?\nMật mã Tây Tạng không chỉ tạo nên một hiện tượng xuất bản lớn đối Trung Quốc mà còn khiến hàng nghìn độc giả trở nên say mê thám hiểm. Mảnh đất Tây Tạng từ xưa vốn chứa đựng nhiều bí ẩn lịch sử cũng như huyền thoại vẫn là nơi gọi mời những ai có khát vọng khám phá. Cuốn sách của Hà Mã giống như một trận cuồng phong thổi bùng lên khao khát được băng mình vào một trong những chốn hùng vĩ nhưng cũng hiểm nguy nhất thế giới, để đích thân trải nghiệm những điều được Hã Mã diễn tả chi tiết với niềm say mê vùng đất anh đã hơn mười năm ẩn dật.\nTác phẩm này đồng thời cũng nhận được nhiều lời khen ngợi của các nhà phê bình như một đại hùng thư của thời hiện đại, thậm chí gọi đó là “Sử thi Hà Mã” bởi lượng kiến thức khổng lồ về thiên nhiên, con người, văn hóa mà đặc biệt là phật giáo Tây Tạng mà Hà Mã đã đưa vào tác phẩm. Mật Mã Tây Tạng cũng thể hiện được tài năng kể chuyện đặc biệt lôi cuốn của tác giả khi anh khéo léo đan cài hàng trăm chi tiết liên quan đến truyền thuyết, lịch sử, khoa học, những cuộc săn đuổi rợn người hay những âm mưu tinh vi thâm hậu vào hành trình tìm kiếm của Trác Mộc Cường Ba. Đó có lẽ là những nét chủ đạo làm nên sức hấp dẫn cho bộ kỳ thư về vùng đất thiếng dưới góc nhìn thám hiểm này.\n",

Sự im lặng của bầy cừu hội tụ đầy đủ những yếu tố làm nên một cuốn tiểu thuyết trinh thám kinh dị xuất sắc nhất: không một dấu vết lúng túng trong những chi tiết thuộc lĩnh vực chuyên môn, với các tình tiết giật gân, cái chết luôn lơ lửng, với cuộc so găng của những bộ óc lớn mà không có chỗ cho kẻ ngu ngốc để cuộc chơi trí tuệ trở nên dễ dàng. Bồi đắp vào cốt truyện lôi cuốn đó là cơ hội được trải nghiệm trong trí não của cả kẻ gây tội lẫn kẻ thi hành công lý, khi mỗi bên phải vật vã trong ngục tù của đau đớn để tìm kiếm, khẩn thiết và liên tục, một sự lắng dịu cho tâm hồn.\n2.

    "description": "Minh tướng quân quyền khuynh triều chính, oai khiếp giang hồ, không ngừng ra tay bài trừ dị kỉ, giết kẻ trung lương, lại dẫn theo cánh quân xâm lược bạo tàn ra Tái Ngoại, đẩy biết bao con người vào cơn nước lửa tang thương, khiến tám phương chấn động. Người trong giang hồ vô cùng căm phẫn, liên tiếp nổi lên, Xảo Chuyết đại sư đoán việc như thần, Ngụy công tử tài hoa diệu vợi, Trùng đại sư chính nghĩa ngút trời, Ám khí vương một thân hào khí, Toái Không đao nhiệt huyết sôi trào, tất cả họ lần lượt viết ra những khúc ca tráng liệt mà hoa lệ, làm nền tảng cho một cuộc lật đổ ngày sau.\nDưới ngòi bút của tác giả, thế giới giang hồ trong hệ liệt Minh tướng quân hiện lên như thực như ảo, đó là một giang hồ truyền thống với những bang phái chính tà và đủ hạng người trung lương gian ác, nhưng đó cũng là một giang hồ riêng biệt khi chạy song song với những mưu mô chính trị chốn triều đình, những thân phận như hiệp khách giang hồ và quan lại triều đình đôi lúc tưởng chừng hòa vào làm một. Thủ pháp xây dựng nhân vật của tác giả cũng thật sự tài tình, mỗi nhân vật hiện lên chỉ bằng vài ngòi bút nhưng cũng đủ để lại cho người đọc những ấn tượng sâu sắc, chỉ ngó riêng phần miêu tả về “một vị tướng quân, nửa gã tổng quản, ba tay chưởng môn, bốn tên công tử, thiên hoa lóe sáng, bát phương danh động” cũng đủ thấy được phần nào. Đến sau này, càng bước vào sâu trong tác phẩm, tính cách mỗi nhân vật lại càng thêm sâu sắc, mỗi người đều có những lý tưởng, mục tiêu riêng, như Lâm Thanh chuyên tâm truy cầu võ đạo, Trùng đại sư một lòng vệ đạo trừ ma, Diệp Phong khát khao sự tự do và tình ái, thậm chí đến những kẻ tiểu nhân phản diện như Tiết Bát Mặc, Ninh Hồi Phong cũng là những tính cách riêng biệt khó có thể lẫn vào đâu.\nVề tình tiết truyện, đây lại càng là một tuyệt phẩm khó có thể bỏ qua, mạch truyện khi cần nhanh thì nhanh, khi cần chậm thì chậm, lên bổng xuống trầm, kéo người đọc đi qua mọi cung bậc cảm xúc, bi hoan ly hợp hào tình nhiệt huyết chan hòa. Đi theo bước chân Tiểu Huyền, từng bước khám phá giang hồ thần bí, từng bước phá tan những cuộc mưu mô, lại phải tự thân trải qua những nỗi đau thương xé ruột, hỏi mấy ai cầm nổi lệ nóng tuôn trào? Lại dõi theo con đường của Diệp Phong, một thanh Toái Không đao trong tay mọi kẻ thù đều biến sắc, cái đầu địch nhân, chỉ một đao là chém vỡ tan, hỏi mấy ai ngăn được dòng máu nóng sục sôi?\nNgoài những điều kể trên, mỗi tập truyện trong hệ liệt Minh tướng quân đều có một tinh thần riêng, như Thâu Thiên Cung là khúc tráng ca cho lý tưởng, Phá Lãng Trùy là câu chuyện về ân oán tình thù, Thiết Hồn Ảnh là một bài ca chính nghĩa, Hoán Nhật Tiễn là hành trình của vận mệnh, Tuyệt Đỉnh là một cuộc quyết chiến khoáng hậu không tiền, Toái Không Đao là chén rượu nồng về tình yêu và sự tự do. Viết được đến độ như thế, trong giới võ hiệp xưa nay hỏi có mấy ai, há lại chẳng đáng để mong chờ?\nBộ Phá Lãng Trùy - Thiết Hồn Ảnh nằm trong bộ trường thiên tiểu thuyết Thâu Thiên Cung hệ liệt của tác giả Thời Vị Hàn.\n \n\n",

Bốn thầy trò hiện lên như bốn tính cách điển hình sống mãi trong lòng độc giả: Đường Tăng từ bi, khoan dung nhưng yếu mềm, Tôn Ngộ Không thần thông quảng đại, tinh thần phản kháng quật cường; Trư Bát Giới tự tư tự lợi, ham ăn lười làm; Sa Tăng chịu thương chịu khó, hết mực trung thành…\nTrong các danh tác kinh điển, Tây du ký có một vị trí đặc biệt, bởi sức hấp dẫn kỳ lạ. Thiếu nhi thì mê mẩn vì yêu thích Tôn Ngộ Không thần thông quảng đại, buồn cười Trư Bát Giới ngộ nghĩnh, vụng về… Người lớn say mê bởi ẩn giữa lớp lang trùng điệp của cốt truyện là những triết lý cao thâm về cuộc sống, kiếp người; giấu trong biến chuyển của thế giới thần tiên ma quỷ là những điều rất bình dị, đời thường…Dựa trên câu chuyện lấy kinh thời nhà Đường, Tây du ký đã phác họa lên bốn hình tượng điển hình: Đường Tăng nhân từ nhưng thiếu sắc sảo, Tôn Ngộ Không tài trí song toàn, dũng cảm kiên định, Trư Bát Giới tham lam ích kỷ; Sa Tăng thật thà tốt tính. Bên cạnh đó là đám yêu ma quỷ quái muôn hình vạn trạng, thủ đoạn khó lường…\nTác giả đã vận dụng thành công bút pháp của chủ nghĩa lãng mạn tích cực để xây dựng lên một cốt truyện nhiều lớp lang, thắt nút mở nút đầy bất ngờ, ngôn ngữ sinh động dí dỏm khiến người đọc bị hút vào đó.

Cú nhảy tới một mét của Mã Tiểu Khiêu khi mới ba tháng tuổi làm mọi người kinh ngạc nhưng lại giúp ông bố Mã Thiên Tiếu của cậu phát minh ra loại đồ chơi có một không hai “Búp bê biết nhảy”. Tiểu Khiêu không chỉ ham chơi mà còn vô cùng tinh nghịch. Bố Thiên Tiếu cũng chẳng kém đâu nhé. Ông không chỉ là người có tâm hồn trẻ thơ mà còn là người rất hiểu suy nghĩ của Tiểu Khiêu. Chính vì thế khi Mã Tiểu Khiêu chỉ thích đi học nếu có “cô giáo xinh đẹp” dạy là ông hiểu ngay vấn đề.\nMã Tiểu Khiêu nghịch ngợm gây hết phiền phức này đến phiền phức khác cho ông bố Mã Thiên Tiếu, khiến ông phải đến trường gặp cô giáo chủ nhiệm như cơm bữa, nhưng có lúc lại vô cùng chín chắn, cậu bé nhất định tuyệt thực để bảo vệ những con vật tội nghiệp. Sự hồn nhiên của Mã Tiểu Khiêu cũng là điểm sáng trong truyện, cô Tần vì muốn có một giờ dự giờ tốt, nên đã chuẩn bị bài giảng rất kỹ từ trước, nhưng đến khi vào giờ thật, chỉ một câu nói của Mã Tiểu Khiêu: \"Lộ Mạn Mạn nói không hay bằng lần tập trước\" đã khiến cho cả lớp \"cười vỡ bụng”, điều này liệu có thể trách Mã Tiểu Khiêu là nghịch ngợm, phá phách được không.

Kỷ lục của 1Q84 còn có ý nghĩa hơn nữa bởi vì đây là tác phẩm văn học đầu tiên kể từ năm 1990 giành được danh hiệu “cuốn sách bán chạy nhất trong năm” ở Nhật. Trước đó, danh hiệu này thường chỉ thuộc về các loại sách tra cứu mang tính giải trí, các cuốn hồi ký chính trị hoặc tư liệu.\nTheo lời nhà văn Haruki Murakami, cuốn 1Q84 có thể coi là câu trả lời độc đáo đối với cuốn 1984, cuốn tiểu thuyết được coi là kinh điển của văn hào Anh George Orwell. (Cũng nên biết thêm trong tiếng Nhật, chữ Q phát âm gần giống cách phát âm số 9 trong tiếng Anh).\nHaruki Murakami năm nay đã 60 tuổi. Ông là nhà văn Nhật được biết đến nhiều nhất ở nước ngoài. Tất cả các cuốn tiểu thuyết của ông đều bán rất chạy, chẳng hạn như các cuốn Biên niên ký chim vặn dây cót, Rừng Na Uy, Kafka bên bờ biển. Ông cũng được coi là một trong những ứng cử viên nặng ký cho giải Nobel văn học trong tương lai mặc dù ông đã có lần tuyên bố không coi trọng các giải thưởng văn học. Theo lời ông, phần thưởng lớn nhất đối với nhà văn là được độc giả yêu mến\n",

Trẻ con thì thấy giống quá, người lớn thì thấy nhớ quá...Trò hờn dỗi luôn được nhóc Nicolas gào lên ở mọi lúc, mọi nơi khi nó gặp phải chuyện gì không vừa ý. Từ việc làn da đỏ au khi đi biển về không kiếm đâu bạn thân để ngắm, lần đầu tiên ăn cơm ở trường cảm giác đáng sợ làm sao, phải làm bài tập số học kinh hoàng đến thế nào, vì điểm “Không” môn Ngữ pháp nên bị cấm xem phim... cho tới hôm bài chính tả ít lỗi nhất lớp không được bố mẹ xem xét nghiêm chỉnh. Nhóc Nicolas lặp mãi bài ca: Nếu cứ bị mọi người ép sẽ phát chán mà bỏ nhà ra đi, sẽ bị chết và cả nhà tha hồ mà thương tiếc...\nNhưng Nicolas chẳng mấy khi thành công với trò ăn vạ đó, bởi nó bị bố mẹ lờ như không biết chuyện gì xảy ra. Nicolas cũng chẳng phật lòng, bởi ngay lập tức cu cậu tìm cho mình vô khối trò chơi mới. Đụng đâu cũng đổ vỡ, càng cố gắng ngoan càng làm hỏng nhiều việc. Như cái lần giúp Clotaine chuyển nhà, cả bọn đã phá tung các thùng đã nhét chặt đồ đạc bên trong khiến bố của Clotaine đành rút tiền tống chúng vào rạp xem phim. Chỉ vì thèm món bánh nhân táo, Nicolas buộc phải ngoan, bằng cách dẫu chơi bi thắng thằng bạn thân đành móc trả vì sợ nó gào lên mình sẽ bị phạt; bằng cách đành phải xé trang trong cuốn sách bà tặng, vì lỡ bố lên phòng bắt gặp sẽ đi đời món bánh táo; đến nỗi nó suýt oà khóc đã không được chơi chỉ tại “món bánh kem đểu cáng”. Còn lần nhóc tự dọn nhà cửa thì ôi thôi. Cái máy bay bay thử đã làm vỡ một cái bình ở phòng ăn. Lấy dao cạo điện của bố để cạo lông con gấu thì dao bị hỏng. Sắp xếp đồ chơi vào tủ thì không vừa nên nó vứt qua cửa sổ làm vỡ cái vòm kính. Muốn dọn đống kính vỡ thì làm hỏng tiếp máy hút bụi. Nổi hứng lau nhà nên làm vỡ cái liễn đẹp nhất của mẹ, chưa kể 2 cái đĩa và kèm theo là nước chảy lênh láng khắp nhà.\nNhững người lớn trong câu chuyện cũng quậy ra trò. Mẹ suốt ngày gào lên quá bức bối với chuyện suốt ngày phải lo cơm nước. Bố cũng hay cáu vì công việc quá bận rộn, về nhà lại phải giúp Nicolas làm môn số học và tập làm văn. Cũng tại bố tính kém nên thỉnh thoảng bài số học của Nicolas bị điểm “Không”. Thày giáo giám sát giờ ra chơi, sau một hồi ngắm nghía lũ trẻ nghịch cũng nhảy vào bày trò đến nỗi bị thôi việc. Bác hàng xóm Blédurt luôn tìm cách cãi cọ với bố, từ cuộc chơi bóng chày cho đến vụ ầm ĩ với cây kèn trompét. Cô giáo được tụi trẻ vô cùng yêu quý đành bất lực khi buổi xem xiếc bị gác giữa chừng vì lũ học trò không chịu ngồi im. Còn vụ dự giờ của các ông bố bà mẹ thành một cuộc tính nhẩm bài toán trên bảng, mà rất tiếc không có ai tìm ra đáp số đúng.\nLàm quen với những đứa trẻ quậy như quỷ sứ ấy, bạn sẽ chợt có một tình cảm dịu êm vô bờ bến, một sự dịu dàng mà từ ấu thơ người ta vẫn dành cho người mình vô cùng yêu thương.\nTrọn bộ gồm 8 cuốn\nNhóc Nicolas: Những Chuyện Chưa Kể (Tập 1)\nNhóc Nicolas: Những Chuyện Chưa Kể (Tập 2)\nNhóc Nicolas: Những Chuyện Chưa Kể 3\nNhóc Nicolas Và Các Bạn\nNhóc Nicolas (Tái Bản)\nNhóc Nicolas: Quả Bóng Và Những Chuyện Chưa Kể Khác\nNhóc Nicolas Phiền Muộn\nGiờ ra chơi của Nhóc Nicolas\n",

Cậu mất đột ngột trong một tai nạn đụng xe trên đường, khi chỉ mới mười sáu tuổi. Đây thực sự là một mất mát lớn đối với gia đình Michael và đặc biệt là với Scarlett. Nếu như trước kia Scarlett vô cùng mạnh mẽ thì giờ đây, cô bạn gái Halley yếu đuối ngày nào bỗng trở thành một điểm tựa tinh thần không gì thay thế được.\n",
